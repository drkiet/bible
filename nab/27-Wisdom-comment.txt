*** the book of Wisdom ***
*** chapter 1 ***

* [1:1–6:21] The reward is the gift of immortality, to the righteous (1:15; 3:1–3), but not to the wicked (5:1–13). Contrasts between these two groups dominate chaps. 1–5. The philosophy of the wicked and their persecution of the righteous are dramatically presented in 1:16–2:24. New light is shed on the suffering of the righteous (3:1–9), childlessness (3:13–15), and premature death (4:7–16)—in contrast to the fate of the wicked (3:10–12, 16–19; 4:3–6, 17–20).
* [1:1] Righteousness: not merely the cardinal virtue of justice (cf. 8:7), but the universal moral quality which is the application of wisdom to moral conduct. You who judge: “judges” and “kings” (cf. 6:1) are addressed in accordance with the literary customs of the times and with the putative Solomonic authorship, but the real audience is the Jewish community.
* [1:4] In these verses personified Wisdom is identified with the spirit of the Lord; so also in 9:17.
* [1:5] Discipline: here and elsewhere, another name for Wisdom.
* [1:11] Calumny: speech against God and divine providence is meant.
* [1:12] Death: as will become clear, the author is not speaking of physical death but of spiritual death, the eternal separation from God.
* [1:14] Hades: the Greek term for the Hebrew Sheol, the dwelling place of the dead.
* [1:15] Undying: immortality is not seen as an innate quality of the soul but as a gift of God to the righteous.

*** chapter 2 ***

* [2:1–20] In this speech the wicked deny survival after death and indeed invite death by their evil deeds.
* [2:12–5:23] From 2:12 to 5:23 the author draws heavily on Is 52–62, setting forth his teaching in a series of characters or types taken from Isaiah and embellished with additional details from other texts. The description of the “righteous one” in 2:12–20 seems to undergird the New Testament passion narrative.
* [2:12] Law: the law of Moses; “training” has the same meaning.
* [2:22] This verse announces the subject of the next section.
* [2:24] Envy: perhaps because Adam was in the image of God or because Adam had control over all creation. Devil: the first biblical text to equate the serpent of Gn 3 with the devil.

*** chapter 3 ***

* [3:1–4:19] The central section of chaps. 1–6. The author begins by stating that immortality is the reward of the righteous, and then in the light of that belief comments on three points of the traditional discussion of the problem of retribution (suffering, childlessness, early death) each of which was often seen as a divine punishment.
* [3:1–12] The author affirms that, for the righteous, sufferings are not punishments but purification and opportunities to show fidelity, whereas for the wicked suffering is truly a punishment.
* [3:6] Offerings: the image is that of the burnt offering, in which the victim is completely consumed by fire.
* [3:7] Judgment: the Greek episkopē is God’s loving judgment of those who have been faithful to him; the same word is used in 14:11 for the punishment of the wicked at God’s judgment. Cf. also v. 13.
* [3:10] To match their thoughts: a fate as empty as that which they describe in 2:1–5.
* [3:13–4:6] The true fruit of life is not children but virtue which leads to immortality. The many children of the wicked will be a disappointing fruit.
* [3:13] See vv. 7–9.
* [3:14] Fidelity’s choice reward: cf. Is 56:1–8. More gratifying: better than sons and daughters; cf. Is 56:5.
* [3:15] Root of understanding: the root that is understanding (wisdom).
* [3:16] Adulterers: understood here as a type of sinners in general; cf. Is 57:3–5.

*** chapter 4 ***

* [4:7–19] Early death is not a punishment for the righteous because genuine old age is the attainment of perfection and early death is a preservation from corruption. The old age and death of the wicked, however, will not be honorable.
* [4:10–11] There are allusions here to Enoch (Gn 5:21–24), who was young by patriarchal standards, and to Lot (Gn 19:10–11; 2 Pt 2:7–8). Cf. also Is 57:1–2.
* [4:14] Verse 15 is omitted because it repeats the last two lines of 3:9.

*** chapter 5 ***

* [5:1–13] In contrast to their speech in chap. 2 the wicked now regret their assessment of life and righteousness.
* [5:5] Heavenly beings: lit., “sons of God.” These are the holy ones, members of the heavenly court, among whom the righteous are to be found. A bodily resurrection does not seem to be envisioned.
* [5:14–23] A picture of the reward of the righteous which develops into an apocalyptic description of the divine warrior’s destruction of evil. The author utilizes Is 59–62.

*** chapter 6 ***

* [6:1–21] The first part of the book closes with an exhortation comparable to 1:1–15, and it leads into “Solomon’s” personal comments on wisdom in chaps. 7–9.
* [6:1] Kings…magistrates: note the inclusion with v. 21 (“kings”). The address to earthly powers is in accord with the opening (1:1), but the true audience remains the Jewish community.
* [6:4] Law: that of Moses; cf. 2:12; 6:10.
* [6:10] Response: a suitable plea before the great Judge. Cf. Prv 22:21; Jb 31:14; Hb 2:1; Sir 8:9.
* [6:17–20] This type of reasoning approximates the rhetorical sorites, a series of statements in which the predicate of each becomes the subject of the next. Cf. Rom 5:3–5.
* [6:22–9:18] In these verses the author identifies with Solomon (without mentioning that name anywhere), and praises the beauty of Wisdom, describing how he sought her out. Thus the readers of the book can find a model in their search for Wisdom.

*** chapter 7 ***

* [7:1] First one formed of earth: Adam. The author omits throughout the book the proper names of the characters in sacred history of whom he speaks; see especially chap. 10.
* [7:2] In a ten-month period: ten lunar months.
* [7:12] Mother: lit., “she who begets.” Although Wisdom herself is begotten of God (Prv 8:22–24), she is here the one who brings into being.
* [7:14] Discipline: cf. note on 1:5.
* [7:17–22a] Wisdom teaches not only righteousness and friendship with God but also sound knowledge of the world, the universe, plants, animals and human beings. See also 1 Kgs 5:9–14; these specialties reflect Hellenistic culture.
* [7:22b–23] The twenty-one (7 × 3) attributes of the spirit in Wisdom reflect the influence of contemporary philosophy, especially the Stoa, but the personification rests also on Prv 8:22–31 and Sir 24.
* [7:25–26] Five strong metaphors underline the origins and closeness of Wisdom with God. See the use of this language in Heb 1:3; Col 1:15.

*** chapter 8 ***

* [8:2] I loved…my bride: the erotic quality in the pursuit of and living with Woman Wisdom, who is the Lord’s consort (9:4) and loved by him, continues throughout this chapter (vv. 16, 18). It is reflected already in Prv 4:5–9; 7:4–5. See also Sir 15:2–5; 51:13–21.
* [8:7] Moderation…fortitude: known also as the cardinal virtues, and recognized in Greek philosophy (Plato).
* [8:12] Hands upon their mouths: a sign of respect for unanswerable wisdom; cf. Jb 40:4.
* [8:19–20] Here the author mentions first bodily, then spiritual, excellence. To make it plain that the latter is the governing factor in the harmonious development of the human person, he then reverses the order. The Platonic doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul is often read into these lines, but such an anthropology does not seem to be the intent of the author (cf. 7:1–6). Verse 20 appears to rule out any misunderstanding of v. 19. Verse 21 emphasizes that he did not bring talent to his “birth”; his wisdom is the gift of God.

*** chapter 9 ***

* [9:1–18] The author presents his version of Solomon’s prayer (1 Kgs 3:6–9; 2 Chr 1:8–10).
* [9:1–2] The author identifies Wisdom with the word of God just as he again identifies Wisdom with the spirit of God in v. 17. All three are alternate ways of expressing God’s activity in relationship with the world and its inhabitants.
* [9:15–17] Although the expressions in v. 15 draw on the language of Plato concerning the human condition, the conclusion is very biblical: God remains a mystery (Jb 38–39; Eccl 8:17; Is 40:12–14; Rom 11:33–34). The plight of humankind is clearly one of ignorance, unless the “holy spirit” is sent from God.
* [9:18] An announcement of the next section.

*** chapter 10 ***

* [10:1–21] This chapter prepares for the following section (Wis 11:2–19:22) on the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. It has a parallel in Sir 44–50; cf. also Wis 18:9.
* [10:1–2] Adam.
* [10:3] Cain.
* [10:4] Noah.
* [10:5] Abraham.
* [10:6] Lot. Pentapolis: the five cities, including Sodom; cf. Gn 14:2.
* [10:7] Disbelieving soul: Lot’s wife; cf. Gn 19:26.
* [10:10–12] Jacob.
* [10:12] Devotion to God: in the Greek this signifies “piety” or “religion,” and is the equivalent of the Hebrew “fear of the Lord”; cf. Prv 1:7.
* [10:13–14] Joseph.
* [10:16] Moses.
* [10:19] Churned them up: casting their bodies on the shore.

*** chapter 11 ***

* [11:2–19:22] Few verses in chaps. 11–19 can be fully understood without consulting the passages in the Pentateuch which are indicated in the cross-references. The theme of this part of the book is expressed in v. 5 and is illustrated in the following chapters by five examples drawn from Exodus events.
* [11:6–8] River: the Nile; the contrast is between the first plague of Egypt (Ex 7:17–24) and the water drawn from the rock in Horeb (Ex 17:5–7; Nm 20:8–11).
* [11:12] Twofold grief: the double distress described in vv. 13–14.
* [11:15] Dumb: that is, irrational.
* [11:17] Formless matter: a Greek philosophical concept is used to interpret the chaos of Gn 1:2.
* [11:22] Grain from a balance: a tiny particle used for weighing on sensitive scales.
* [11:23] The combination of divine mercy and power is an unusual paradox, but cf. 12:15–18; Ps 62:12–13; Sir 2:18. The main emphasis is on a creating that is motivated by love; the divine “imperishable spirit” (either Wisdom as in 1:4, 7, or perhaps the breath of life as in Gn 2:7) is in everything (12:1).

*** chapter 12 ***

* [12:5] The horrible crimes here attributed to the Canaanites (cf. also 14:23) were not unheard of in the ancient world.
* [12:17] The brunt of divine anger and justice is borne by those who know God but defy divine authority and might. Cf. 1:2; 15:2, but also 12:27; 18:13.
* [12:27] Condemnation: the death of Egyptian firstborn and the destruction of their army in the sea.

*** chapter 13 ***

* [13:1–9] The author holds a relatively benign view of the efforts of the philosophers to come to know God from various natural phenomena. This is not a question of proving the existence of God in scholastic style. The author thinks that the beauty and might of the world should have pointed by analogy (v. 5) to the Maker. Instead, those “in ignorance of God” remained fixed on the elements (v. 2, three named, along with the stars). His Greek counterparts are not totally blameless; they should have gone further and acknowledged the creator of nature’s wonders (vv. 4–5). Cf. Rom 1:18–23; Acts 17:27–28.
* [13:1] One who is: this follows the Greek translation of the sacred name for God in Hebrew; cf. Ex 3:14.
* [13:2] Governors: the sun and moon (cf. Gn 1:16).
* [13:6] The blame is less: the greater blame is incurred by those mentioned in v. 10; 15:14–16.
* [13:10–19] The second digression is an example of the polemic against idolatry (cf. Is 44:9–20; Jer 10:3–9; Ps 135:15–18). Whether the idols be of wood or clay, they were made by human beings and have become the source of evil.

*** chapter 14 ***

* [14:3–6] The wooden ship mentioned in vv. 1–2 prompts a short meditation on the providence of God, who in fact has watched over boats in their dangerous courses. The wood as described in v. 7 became a favorite patristic type for the wood of the cross.
* [14:6] Noah.
* [14:15–21] The author develops two examples of idolatry: cult of the dead, and cult of the king.
* [14:19] Likeness: he made this more flattering than the reality.
* [14:30] Piety: the sanctity of oaths.
* [14:31] Perjury is a form of deceit which calls for punishment even though it be practiced in the name of a lifeless idol.

*** chapter 15 ***

* [15:1–3] As often before (11:26; 12:2; 14:3–6), the author addresses God directly, so that chaps. 11–19 can be conceived as a more or less continuous prayer (cf. 11:7 and 19:22). This is the living God who is in stark contrast to the deadness of the idols that have been discussed. The merciful God (cf. Ex 34:6) is the source of immortality (1:15) for the community.
* [15:8–9] The author matches the irony of his words about the carpenter in 13:15–19 with this description of the potter’s vain work.
* [15:10] Ashes his heart is!: the words of this cry are taken from Is 44:20 (the Septuagint).
* [15:18–19] The author here returns (11:15; 12:23–27) to the main theme of chaps. 11–19, which was interrupted by the digression of 13:1–15:17.
* [15:18] Worse than the rest: this may mean that the creatures worshiped by the Egyptians (e.g., crocodiles, serpents, scarabs, etc.) were less intelligent than the general run of beasts.

*** chapter 16 ***

* [16:1] They: the Egyptian idolaters, who are punished according to the principle laid down in 11:5, 15–16.
* [16:6] Sign: the brazen serpent, as related in Numbers 21, but the author deliberately avoids any misunderstanding by addressing the Lord as responsible for the healing, since he is “the savior of all” (v. 7; see also vv. 12 and 26 for the role of the “word” of God).
* [16:13–14] The author recognizes the power of the Lord over life and death, as expressed in 1 Sm 2:6; Tb 13:2. The traditional imagery of Sheol (gates and confinement) colors the passage.
* [16:20] Food of angels: the famous phrase (cf. the hymn “Panis Angelicus”) is taken from Ps 78:24 as rendered by the Septuagint. The “bread from heaven” (cf. Ex 16:4; Ps 105:40) with its marvelous “sweetness” becomes a type of the “bread come down from heaven” in Jn 6:32–51, and plays a large role in later Christian devotion.
* [16:22] Snow and ice: the manna; cf. v. 27; 19:21.

*** chapter 17 ***

* [17:1–18:4] The description of the darkness of the ninth plague is a very creative development of Ex 10:21–29. It betrays a wide knowledge of contemporary thought. For the first and only time in the Septuagint the Greek word for “conscience” occurs, in 17:11. There is no Hebrew word that is equivalent; the idea is expressed indirectly. The horrendous darkness is illumined by “fires” (v. 6), i.e., lightnings that only contributed to the terror.
* [17:7] Magic art: the Egyptian magicians who were successful at first (Ex 7:11, 22) and then failed (Ex 8:14; 9:11) are now powerless against the darkness and the phantoms and are totally discredited.
* [17:14] Powerless: Hades (or Sheol), i.e., the nether world, is often portrayed in the Old Testament as a hostile power, since all must die (Ps 49:8–13), but it has no power against God.
* [17:21] Darkness: of Hades or Sheol; see note on 16:13–14.

*** chapter 18 ***

* [18:2] The difference between them: God’s distinctive manner of treating the Israelites and the Egyptians according to their respective deeds. Pleaded: perhaps, for their departure.
* [18:4] The discussion of physical light climaxes with a reference to the “imperishable light” of the torah.
* [18:5] Single boy: Moses.
* [18:9] Divine institution: the Passover. Ancestral hymns of praise: possibly the Hallel psalms, the psalms sung at the end of the Passover meal; cf. Mt 26:30; Mk 14:26.
* [18:13] People: the Israelites (cf. Ex 4:22).
* [18:14–16] These verses attribute to the personified “word” the actions of the Lord mentioned in Ex 12:13–17 (note the role of the “destroyer” in Ex 12:23 and compare Wis 18:22, 25).
* [18:21] Blameless man: Aaron, acting according to his office of high priest and intercessor (cf. Nm 17:9–15; Ex 28:15–21, 31–38).
* [18:22] Smiter: the destroying angel; cf. v. 25.
* [18:24] Glories…grandeur: the name of God and the names of the tribes were inscribed on the high priest’s apparel.

*** chapter 19 ***

* [19:5] Glorious: more precisely, “wondrous,” but the word reflects “glorified” in 18:8 and 19:22.
* [19:6] The cooperation of creation in Israel’s deliverance (vv. 7–12) under the direction of the Lord is a favorite theme; cf. 16:24–25.
* [19:13] More grievous: than that of the people of Sodom (Gn 19) with whom the Egyptians are compared.
* [19:14] Others: the people of Sodom refused to receive strangers. Beneficent: because of the services rendered by Joseph.
* [19:15] Theirs: the people of Sodom.
* [19:16] These: the Egyptians.
* [19:17] Blindness: the plague of darkness. Righteous man: Lot (Gn 19:11).
