*** the book of Mark ***
*** chapter 1 ***

1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ [the Son of God].* The Preaching of John the Baptist.
2 a As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:* b “Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you; he will prepare your way.
3 c A voice of one crying out in the desert: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.’”
4 John [the] Baptist appeared in the desert proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
5 People of the whole Judean countryside and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they acknowledged their sins.
6 John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist.* He fed on locusts and wild honey.
7 And this is what he proclaimed: “One mightier than I is coming after me. I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals.
8 * d I have baptized you with water; he will baptize you with the holy Spirit.” The Baptism of Jesus.
9 e It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
10 On coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him.*
11 f And a voice came from the heavens, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” The Temptation of Jesus.*
12 At once the Spirit drove him out into the desert,g
13 and he remained in the desert for forty days, tempted by Satan. He was among wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him. The Beginning of the Galilean Ministry.
14 h After John had been arrested,* Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God:
15 i “This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.” The Call of the First Disciples.*
16 j As he passed by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea; they were fishermen.
17 Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
18 Then they abandoned their nets and followed him.
19 He walked along a little farther and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They too were in a boat mending their nets.
20 Then he called them. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat along with the hired men and followed him. The Cure of a Demoniac.
21 * k Then they came to Capernaum, and on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.
22 l The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.
23 * In their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit;
24 * he cried out, “What have you to do with us,* Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
25 Jesus rebuked him and said, “Quiet! Come out of him!”
26 The unclean spirit convulsed him and with a loud cry came out of him.
27 All were amazed and asked one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority. He commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him.”
28 His fame spread everywhere throughout the whole region of Galilee. The Cure of Simon’s Mother-in-Law.
29 m On leaving the synagogue he entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
30 Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever. They immediately told him about her.
31 He approached, grasped her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever left her and she waited on them. Other Healings.
32 When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were ill or possessed by demons.
33 The whole town was gathered at the door.
34 He cured many who were sick with various diseases, and he drove out many demons, not permitting them to speak because they knew him. Jesus Leaves Capernaum.
35 n Rising very early before dawn, he left and went off to a deserted place, where he prayed.
36 Simon and those who were with him pursued him
37 and on finding him said, “Everyone is looking for you.”
38 He told them, “Let us go on to the nearby villages that I may preach there also. For this purpose have I come.”
39 So he went into their synagogues, preaching and driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee. The Cleansing of a Leper.
40 o A leper* came to him [and kneeling down] begged him and said, “If you wish, you can make me clean.”
41 Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand, touched him, and said to him, “I do will it. Be made clean.”p
42 The leprosy left him immediately, and he was made clean.q
43 Then, warning him sternly, he dismissed him at once.
44 Then he said to him, “See that you tell no one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.”r
45 The man went away and began to publicize the whole matter. He spread the report abroad so that it was impossible for Jesus to enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, and people kept coming to him from everywhere.

*** chapter 2 ***

The Healing of a Paralytic.
1 * When Jesus returned to Capernauma after some days, it became known that he was at home.*
2 Many gathered together so that there was no longer room for them, not even around the door, and he preached the word to them.
3 They came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
4 Unable to get near Jesus because of the crowd, they opened up the roof above him. After they had broken through, they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying.
5 * When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”
6 * Now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves,
7 “Why does this man speak that way?* He is blaspheming. Who but God alone can forgive sins?”b
8 Jesus immediately knew in his mind what they were thinking to themselves, so he said, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?
9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, pick up your mat and walk’?
10 * But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth”—
11 he said to the paralytic, “I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home.”
12 He rose, picked up his mat at once, and went away in the sight of everyone. They were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.” The Call of Levi.
13 * c Once again he went out along the sea. All the crowd came to him and he taught them.
14 d As he passed by,* he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the customs post. He said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.
15 While he was at table in his house,* many tax collectors and sinners sat with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.
16 * Some scribes who were Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors and said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
17 Jesus heard this and said to them [that], “Those who are well do not need a physician,* but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.” The Question About Fasting.*
18 The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were accustomed to fast.e People came to him and objected, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
19 Jesus answered them, “Can the wedding guests fast* while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.
20 But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.
21 No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak. If he does, its fullness pulls away, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse.
22 Likewise, no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are ruined. Rather, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins.” The Disciples and the Sabbath.*
23 As he was passing through a field of grain on the sabbath, his disciples began to make a path while picking the heads of grain.f
24 At this the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath?”g
25 He said to them, “Have you never read what David did* when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry?
26 How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of offering that only the priests could lawfully eat, and shared it with his companions?”h
27 Then he said to them, “The sabbath was made for man,* not man for the sabbath.i
28 * That is why the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”

*** chapter 3 ***

A Man with a Withered Hand.
1 * Again he entered the synagogue.a There was a man there who had a withered hand.
2 They watched him closely to see if he would cure him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him.
3 He said to the man with the withered hand, “Come up here before us.”
4 Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil, to save life rather than to destroy it?” But they remained silent.
5 Looking around at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out and his hand was restored.b
6 * The Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him to put him to death. The Mercy of Jesus.
7 * Jesus withdrew toward the sea with his disciples.c A large number of people [followed] from Galilee and from Judea.
8 Hearing what he was doing, a large number of people came to him also from Jerusalem, from Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon.
9 He told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush him.
10 He had cured many and, as a result, those who had diseases were pressing upon him to touch him.d
11 * And whenever unclean spirits saw him they would fall down before him and shout, “You are the Son of God.”e
12 He warned them sternly not to make him known. The Mission of the Twelve.
13 f He went up the mountain* and summoned those whom he wanted and they came to him.
14 g He appointed twelve [whom he also named apostles] that they might be with him* and he might send them forth to preach
15 and to have authority to drive out demons:
16 * [he appointed the twelve:] Simon, whom he named Peter;
17 James, son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, whom he named Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;h
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus, Simon the Cananean,
19 and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.

Blasphemy of the Scribes.
20 * He came home.* Again [the] crowd gathered, making it impossible for them even to eat.i
21 When his relatives heard of this they set out to seize him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”j
22 The scribes who had come from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,”* and “By the prince of demons he drives out demons.”k

Jesus and Beelzebul.
23 Summoning them, he began to speak to them in parables, “How can Satan drive out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
26 And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand; that is the end of him.
27 But no one can enter a strong man’s house to plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.
28 Amen, I say to you, all sins and all blasphemies that people utter will be forgiven them.l
29 But whoever blasphemes against the holy Spirit* will never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an everlasting sin.”
30 For they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.”

Jesus and His Family.
31 m His mother and his brothers arrived. Standing outside they sent word to him and called him.
32 A crowd seated around him told him, “Your mother and your brothers* [and your sisters] are outside asking for you.”
33 But he said to them in reply, “Who are my mother and [my] brothers?”
34 And looking around at those seated in the circle he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.
35 [For] whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”

*** chapter 4 ***

The Parable of the Sower.
1 * On another occasiona he began to teach by the sea.* A very large crowd gathered around him so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down. And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land.b
2 And he taught them at length in parables, and in the course of his instruction he said to them,
3 * “Hear this! A sower went out to sow.
4 And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
5 Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.
6 And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots.
7 Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it and it produced no grain.
8 And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit. It came up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”
9 He added, “Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear.” The Purpose of the Parables.
10 And when he was alone, those present along with the Twelve questioned him about the parables.
11 * He answered them, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been granted to you. But to those outside everything comes in parables,
12 so that ‘they may look and see but not perceive, and hear and listen but not understand, in order that they may not be converted and be forgiven.’”c
13 * Jesus said to them, “Do you not understand this parable?d Then how will you understand any of the parables?
14 The sower sows the word.
15 These are the ones on the path where the word is sown. As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once and takes away the word sown in them.
16 And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy.
17 But they have no root; they last only for a time. Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
18 Those sown among thorns are another sort. They are the people who hear the word,
19 but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches, and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
20 But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.” Parable of the Lamp.
21 e He said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be placed under a bushel basket or under a bed, and not to be placed on a lampstand?f
22 For there is nothing hidden except to be made visible; nothing is secret except to come to light.g
23 Anyone who has ears to hear ought to hear.”
24 He also told them, “Take care what you hear. The measure with which you measure will be measured out to you, and still more will be given to you.h
25 To the one who has, more will be given; from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”i Seed Grows of Itself.
26 He said, “This is how it is with the kingdom of God;* it is as if a man were to scatter seedj on the land
27 and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how.
28 Of its own accord the land yields fruit, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
29 And when the grain is ripe, he wields the sickle at once, for the harvest has come.” The Mustard Seed.
30 k He said, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use for it?
31 It is like a mustard seed that, when it is sown in the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth.
32 * But once it is sown, it springs up and becomes the largest of plants and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the sky can dwell in its shade.”
33 With many such parablesl he spoke the word to them as they were able to understand it.
34 Without parables he did not speak to them, but to his own disciples he explained everything in private. The Calming of a Storm at Sea.
35 * On that day, as evening drew on, he said to them, “Let us cross to the other side.”m
36 Leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat just as he was. And other boats were with him.
37 A violent squall came up and waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was already filling up.
38 Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke him and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”
39 He woke up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Quiet! Be still!”* The wind ceased and there was great calm.
40 Then he asked them, “Why are you terrified? Do you not yet have faith?”
41 * n They were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey?”

*** chapter 5 ***

The Healing of the Gerasene Demoniac.
1 * a They came to the other side of the sea, to the territory of the Gerasenes.
2 When he got out of the boat, at once a man* from the tombs who had an unclean spirit met him.
3 The man had been dwelling among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, even with a chain.
4 In fact, he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains, but the chains had been pulled apart by him and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
5 Night and day among the tombs and on the hillsides he was always crying out and bruising himself with stones.
6 Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran up and prostrated himself before him,
7 crying out in a loud voice, “What have you to do with me,* Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me!”
8 (He had been saying to him, “Unclean spirit, come out of the man!”)
9 * He asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “Legion is my name. There are many of us.”b
10 And he pleaded earnestly with him not to drive them away from that territory.
11 Now a large herd of swine* was feeding there on the hillside.
12 And they pleaded with him, “Send us into the swine. Let us enter them.”
13 And he let them, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine. The herd of about two thousand rushed down a steep bank into the sea, where they were drowned.
14 The swineherds ran away and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside. And people came out to see what had happened.
15 As they approached Jesus, they caught sight of the man who had been possessed by Legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. And they were seized with fear.
16 Those who witnessed the incident explained to them what had happened to the possessed man and to the swine.
17 Then they began to beg him to leave their district.
18 As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed pleaded to remain with him.
19 But he would not permit him but told him instead, “Go home* to your family and announce to them all that the Lord in his pity has done for you.”
20 Then the man went off and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him; and all were amazed. Jairus’s Daughter and the Woman with a Hemorrhage.*
21 When Jesus had crossed again [in the boat] to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he stayed close to the sea.c
22 One of the synagogue officials, named Jairus, came forward.d Seeing him he fell at his feet
23 and pleaded earnestly with him, saying, “My daughter is at the point of death. Please, come lay your hands on her* that she may get well and live.”
24 He went off with him, and a large crowd followed him and pressed upon him.
25 There was a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years.
26 She had suffered greatly at the hands of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet she was not helped but only grew worse.
27 She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.
28 * She said, “If I but touch his clothes, I shall be cured.”
29 Immediately her flow of blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
30 Jesus, aware at once that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who has touched my clothes?”
31 But his disciples said to him, “You see how the crowd is pressing upon you, and yet you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”
32 And he looked around to see who had done it.
33 The woman, realizing what had happened to her, approached in fear and trembling. She fell down before Jesus and told him the whole truth.
34 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace and be cured of your affliction.”e
35 * While he was still speaking, people from the synagogue official’s house arrived and said, “Your daughter has died; why trouble the teacher any longer?”
36 Disregarding the message that was reported, Jesus said to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid; just have faith.”
37 He did not allow anyone to accompany him inside except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.
38 When they arrived at the house of the synagogue official, he caught sight of a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.
39 * f So he went in and said to them, “Why this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.”
40 And they ridiculed him. Then he put them all out. He took along the child’s father and mother and those who were with him and entered the room where the child was.
41 * He took the child by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise!”
42 The girl, a child of twelve, arose immediately and walked around. [At that] they were utterly astounded.
43 He gave strict orders that no one should know this and said that she should be given something to eat.

*** chapter 6 ***

The Rejection at Nazareth.
1 a He departed from there and came to his native place,* accompanied by his disciples.
2 * When the sabbath came he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished. They said, “Where did this man get all this? What kind of wisdom has been given him? What mighty deeds are wrought by his hands!
3 b Is he not the carpenter,* the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.
4 * c Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and among his own kin and in his own house.”
5 So he was not able to perform any mighty deed there,* apart from curing a few sick people by laying his hands on them.
6 He was amazed at their lack of faith. The Mission of the Twelve. He went around to the villages in the vicinity teaching.
7 d He summoned the Twelve* and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over unclean spirits.
8 * He instructed them to take nothing for the journey but a walking stick—no food, no sack, no money in their belts.
9 They were, however, to wear sandals but not a second tunic.
10 * He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave from there.
11 Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.”
12 So they went off and preached repentance.
13 * They drove out many demons, and they anointed with oil many who were sicke and cured them. Herod’s Opinion of Jesus.*
14 King Herod* heard about it, for his fame had become widespread, and people were saying,f “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead; that is why mighty powers are at work in him.”g
15 Others were saying, “He is Elijah”; still others, “He is a prophet like any of the prophets.”h
16 But when Herod learned of it, he said, “It is John whom I beheaded. He has been raised up.” The Death of John the Baptist.*
17 Herod was the one who had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, whom he had married.i
18 John had said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”j
19 Herodias* harbored a grudge against him and wanted to kill him but was unable to do so.
20 Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and kept him in custody. When he heard him speak he was very much perplexed, yet he liked to listen to him.
21 She had an opportunity one day when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers, his military officers, and the leading men of Galilee.
22 Herodias’s own daughter came in and performed a dance that delighted Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask of me whatever you wish and I will grant it to you.”
23 He even swore [many things] to her, “I will grant you whatever you ask of me, even to half of my kingdom.”k
24 She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” She replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”
25 The girl hurried back to the king’s presence and made her request, “I want you to give me at once on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”
26 The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests he did not wish to break his word to her.
27 l So he promptly dispatched an executioner with orders to bring back his head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison.
28 He brought in the head on a platter and gave it to the girl. The girl in turn gave it to her mother.
29 When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. The Return of the Twelve.
30 The apostles* gathered together with Jesus and reported all they had done and taught.m
31 * He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.” People were coming and going in great numbers, and they had no opportunity even to eat.n
32 So they went off in the boat by themselves to a deserted place.o
33 People saw them leaving and many came to know about it. They hastened there on foot from all the towns and arrived at the place before them. The Feeding of the Five Thousand.
34 When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.
35 * By now it was already late and his disciples approached him and said, “This is a deserted place and it is already very late.
36 Dismiss them so that they can go to the surrounding farms and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
37 He said to them in reply, “Give them some food yourselves.” But they said to him, “Are we to buy two hundred days’ wages worth of food and give it to them to eat?”
38 He asked them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they had found out they said, “Five loaves and two fish.”
39 So he gave orders to have them sit down in groups on the green grass.
40 * The people took their places in rows by hundreds and by fifties.
41 Then, taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to [his] disciples to set before the people; he also divided the two fish among them all.*
42 They all ate and were satisfied.
43 And they picked up twelve wicker baskets full of fragments and what was left of the fish.
44 Those who ate [of the loaves] were five thousand men. The Walking on the Water.*
45 Then he made his disciples get into the boatp and precede him to the other side toward Bethsaida,* while he dismissed the crowd.
46 * And when he had taken leave of them, he went off to the mountain to pray.
47 When it was evening, the boat was far out on the sea and he was alone on shore.
48 Then he saw that they were tossed about while rowing, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them walking on the sea.* He meant to pass by them.
49 But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out.
50 * They had all seen him and were terrified. But at once he spoke with them, “Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid!”
51 He got into the boat with them and the wind died down. They were [completely] astounded.
52 They had not understood the incident of the loaves.* On the contrary, their hearts were hardened.q The Healings at Gennesaret.
53 r After making the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret and tied up there.
54 As they were leaving the boat, people immediately recognized him.
55 They scurried about the surrounding country and began to bring in the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
56 Whatever villages or towns or countryside he entered, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch only the tassel on his cloak; and as many as touched it were healed.s

*** chapter 7 ***

The Tradition of the Elders.*
1 Now when the Pharisees with some scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him,a
2 they observed that some of his disciples ate their meals with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands.
3 (For the Pharisees and, in fact, all Jews, do not eat without carefully washing their hands,* keeping the tradition of the elders.
4 And on coming from the marketplace they do not eat without purifying themselves. And there are many other things that they have traditionally observed, the purification of cups and jugs and kettles [and beds].)
5 So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him, “Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders* but instead eat a meal with unclean hands?”
6 He responded, “Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written:b ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;
7 In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines human precepts.’
8 You disregard God’s commandment but cling to human tradition.”
9 He went on to say, “How well you have set aside the commandment of God in order to uphold your tradition!
10 For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses father or mother shall die.’c
11 Yet you say, ‘If a person says to father or mother, “Any support you might have had from me is qorban”’* (meaning, dedicated to God),
12 you allow him to do nothing more for his father or mother.
13 You nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many such things.”
14 d He summoned the crowd again and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.
15 Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person; but the things that come out from within are what defile.” 
16 *
17 * e When he got home away from the crowd his disciples questioned him about the parable.
18 He said to them, “Are even you likewise without understanding? Do you not realize that everything that goes into a person from outside cannot defile,
19 * f since it enters not the heart but the stomach and passes out into the latrine?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)
20 “But what comes out of a person, that is what defiles.
21 g From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,
22 adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.
23 All these evils come from within and they defile.” The Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith.
24 h From that place he went off to the district of Tyre.* He entered a house and wanted no one to know about it, but he could not escape notice.
25 Soon a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him. She came and fell at his feet.
26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter.i
27 He said to her, “Let the children be fed first.* For it is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs.”
28 She replied and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s scraps.”
29 Then he said to her, “For saying this, you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”
30 When the woman went home, she found the child lying in bed and the demon gone. The Healing of a Deaf Man.
31 j Again he left the district of Tyre and went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, into the district of the Decapolis.
32 And people brought to him a deaf man who had a speech impediment and begged him to lay his hand on him.
33 He took him off by himself away from the crowd. He put his finger into the man’s ears and, spitting, touched his tongue;
34 then he looked up to heaven and groaned, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”)
35 And [immediately] the man’s ears were opened, his speech impediment was removed, and he spoke plainly.
36 * He ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them not to, the more they proclaimed it.
37 They were exceedingly astonished and they said, “He has done all things well. He makes the deaf hear and [the] mute speak.”k

*** chapter 8 ***

The Feeding of the Four Thousand.*
1 In those days when there again was a great crowd without anything to eat,a he summoned the disciples and said,
2 “My heart is moved with pity for the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat.
3 If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will collapse on the way, and some of them have come a great distance.”
4 His disciples answered him, “Where can anyone get enough bread to satisfy them here in this deserted place?”
5 Still he asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” “Seven,” they replied.
6 * He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then, taking the seven loaves he gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed them to the crowd.
7 They also had a few fish. He said the blessing over them and ordered them distributed also.
8 They ate and were satisfied. They picked up the fragments left over—seven baskets.
9 There were about four thousand people. He dismissed them
10 and got into the boat with his disciples and came to the region of Dalmanutha. The Demand for a Sign.
11 * The Pharisees came forward and began to argue with him,b seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.c
12 He sighed from the depth of his spirit and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”
13 Then he left them, got into the boat again, and went off to the other shore. The Leaven of the Pharisees.
14 d They had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
15 * He enjoined them, “Watch out, guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”
16 They concluded among themselves that it was because they had no bread.
17 When he became aware of this he said to them, “Why do you conclude that it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet understand or comprehend? Are your hearts hardened?e
18 Do you have eyes and not see, ears and not hear? And do you not remember,f
19 when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many wicker baskets full of fragments you picked up?” They answered him, “Twelve.”
20 “When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many full baskets of fragments did you pick up?” They answered [him], “Seven.”
21 He said to them, “Do you still not understand?” The Blind Man of Bethsaida.*
22 When they arrived at Bethsaida, they brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.
23 He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. Putting spittle on his eyes he laid his hands on him and asked, “Do you see anything?”g
24 Looking up he replied, “I see people looking like trees and walking.”
25 Then he laid hands on his eyes a second time and he saw clearly; his sight was restored and he could see everything distinctly.
26 Then he sent him home and said, “Do not even go into the village.” Peter’s Confession About Jesus.*
27 Now Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages of Caesarea Philippi.h Along the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”
28 They said in reply, “John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others one of the prophets.”
29 And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter said to him in reply, “You are the Messiah.”
30 Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him. The First Prediction of the Passion.
31 i He began to teach them that the Son of Man* must suffer greatly and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and rise after three days.
32 He spoke this openly. Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
33 At this he turned around and, looking at his disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan. You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do.” The Conditions of Discipleship.
34 He summoned the crowd with his disciples and said* to them, “Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.j
35 For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and that of the gospel* will save it.k
36 What profit is there for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
37 What could one give in exchange for his life?
38 Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this faithless and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”l

*** chapter 9 ***

1 * a He also said to them, “Amen, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come in power.” The Transfiguration of Jesus.*
2 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves.b And he was transfigured before them,
3 and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no fuller on earth could bleach them.
4 Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus.
5 * Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
6 He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified.
7 Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them;* then from the cloud came a voice, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”
8 Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone with them. The Coming of Elijah.*
9 As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.c
10 So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what rising from the dead meant.
11 d Then they asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
12 He told them, “Elijah will indeed come first and restore all things, yet how is it written regarding the Son of Man that he must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt?
13 But I tell you that Elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.”e The Healing of a Boy with a Demon.*
14 When they came to the disciples,f they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.
15 Immediately on seeing him, the whole crowd was utterly amazed. They ran up to him and greeted him.
16 He asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”
17 Someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I have brought to you my son possessed by a mute spirit.
18 Wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable to do so.”
19 He said to them in reply, “O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me.”
20 They brought the boy to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately threw the boy into convulsions. As he fell to the ground, he began to roll around and foam at the mouth.
21 Then he questioned his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” He replied, “Since childhood.
22 It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”
23 Jesus said to him, “‘If you can!’ Everything is possible to one who has faith.”
24 Then the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe, help my unbelief!”
25 Jesus, on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering, rebuked the unclean spirit and said to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you: come out of him and never enter him again!”
26 Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions, it came out. He became like a corpse, which caused many to say, “He is dead!”
27 But Jesus took him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.
28 When he entered the house, his disciples asked him in private, “Why could we not drive it out?”
29 * He said to them, “This kind can only come out through prayer.” The Second Prediction of the Passion.
30 g They left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.h
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death he will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him. The Greatest in the Kingdom.*
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”i
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”j
36 Taking a child he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”k Another Exorcist.*
38 John said to him,l “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us.”
39 Jesus replied, “Do not prevent him. There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me.
40 For whoever is not against us is for us.m
41 Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his reward.n Temptations to Sin.
42 o “Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe [in me] to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna,* into the unquenchable fire. 
44 *
45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into Gehenna. 
46
47 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna,
48 where ‘their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’p The Simile of Salt.
49 * “Everyone will be salted with fire.
50 Salt is good, but if salt becomes insipid, with what will you restore its flavor? Keep salt in yourselves and you will have peace with one another.”q

*** chapter 10 ***

Marriage and Divorce.
1 He set out from there and went into the district of Judea [and] across the Jordan. Again crowds gathered around him and, as was his custom, he again taught them.
2 * The Pharisees approached and asked, “Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife?” They were testing him.a
3 He said to them in reply, “What did Moses command you?”
4 They replied, “Moses permitted him to write a bill of divorce and dismiss her.”b
5 But Jesus told them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts he wrote you this commandment.
6 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.c
7 For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother [and be joined to his wife],d
8 and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh.
9 Therefore what God has joined together, no human being must separate.”
10 In the house the disciples again questioned him about this.
11 e He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;
12 and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.” Blessing of the Children.
13 f And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.g
14 When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to me; do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
15 Amen, I say to you, whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child* will not enter it.”h
16 Then he embraced them and blessed them, placing his hands on them. The Rich Man.
17 i As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up, knelt down before him, and asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
18 Jesus answered him, “Why do you call me good?* No one is good but God alone.
19 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; you shall not defraud; honor your father and your mother.’”j
20 He replied and said to him, “Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth.”
21 Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him, “You are lacking in one thing. Go, sell what you have, and give to [the] poor and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”
22 At that statement his face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
23 * Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”k
24 The disciples were amazed at his words. So Jesus again said to them in reply, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to pass through [the] eye of [a] needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
26 They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves, “Then who can be saved?”
27 Jesus looked at them and said, “For human beings it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God.”
28 Peter began to say to him, “We have given up everything and followed you.”
29 Jesus said, “Amen, I say to you, there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the gospel
30 who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age: houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and eternal life in the age to come.
31 But many that are first will be last, and [the] last will be first.”l The Third Prediction of the Passion.
32 m They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went ahead of them. They were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. Taking the Twelve aside again, he began to tell them what was going to happen to him.
33 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles
34 who will mock him, spit upon him, scourge him, and put him to death, but after three days he will rise.” Ambition of James and John.
35 n Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”
36 He replied, “What do you wish [me] to do for you?”
37 They answered him, “Grant that in your glory we may sit one at your right and the other at your left.”
38 * o Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”
39 They said to him, “We can.” Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;
40 but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared.”
41 When the ten heard this, they became indignant at James and John.
42 * Jesus summoned them and said to them,p “You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones make their authority over them felt.
43 But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant;
44 whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all.
45 For the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.” The Blind Bartimaeus.*
46 They came to Jericho.q And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a sizable crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus, sat by the roadside begging.
47 On hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, son of David, have pity on me.”
48 And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he kept calling out all the more, “Son of David, have pity on me.”
49 Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage; get up, he is calling you.”
50 He threw aside his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
51 Jesus said to him in reply, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man replied to him, “Master, I want to see.”
52 Jesus told him, “Go your way; your faith has saved you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.

*** chapter 11 ***

The Entry into Jerusalem.*
1 When they drew near to Jerusalem,a to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples
2 and said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately on entering it, you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
3 If anyone should say to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ reply, ‘The Master has need of it and will send it back here at once.’”
4 So they went off and found a colt tethered at a gate outside on the street, and they untied it.
5 Some of the bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”
6 They answered them just as Jesus had told them to, and they permitted them to do it.
7 So they brought the colt to Jesus and put their cloaks over it. And he sat on it.
8 Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields.
9 Those preceding him as well as those following kept crying out:b “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is to come! Hosanna in the highest!”
11 He entered Jerusalem and went into the temple area. He looked around at everything and, since it was already late, went out to Bethany with the Twelve.c Jesus Curses a Fig Tree.*
12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany he was hungry.d
13 Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf, he went over to see if he could find anything on it. When he reached it he found nothing but leaves; it was not the time for figs.
14 And he said to it in reply, “May no one ever eat of your fruit again!” And his disciples heard it. Cleansing of the Temple.*
15 They came to Jerusalem,e and on entering the temple area he began to drive out those selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
16 He did not permit anyone to carry anything through the temple area.
17 Then he taught them saying, “Is it not written: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples’? But you have made it a den of thieves.”f
18 The chief priests and the scribes came to hear of it and were seeking a way to put him to death, yet they feared him because the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.
19 When evening came, they went out of the city.g The Withered Fig Tree.
20 h Early in the morning, as they were walking along, they saw the fig tree withered to its roots.
21 Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.”
22 Jesus said to them in reply, “Have faith in God.
23 Amen, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it shall be done for him.i
24 Therefore I tell you, all that you ask for in prayer, believe that you will receive it and it shall be yours.j
25 When you stand to pray, forgive anyone against whom you have a grievance, so that your heavenly Father may in turn forgive you your transgressions.”k 
26 * The Authority of Jesus Questioned.*
27 They returned once more to Jerusalem.l As he was walking in the temple area, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders approached him
28 and said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things? Or who gave you this authority to do them?”
29 Jesus said to them, “I shall ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
30 Was John’s baptism of heavenly or of human origin? Answer me.”
31 They discussed this among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘Of heavenly origin,’ he will say, ‘[Then] why did you not believe him?’
32 But shall we say, ‘Of human origin’?”—they feared the crowd, for they all thought John really was a prophet.
33 So they said to Jesus in reply, “We do not know.” Then Jesus said to them, “Neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

*** chapter 12 ***

Parable of the Tenants.*
1 He began to speak to them in parables.a “A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a wine press, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and left on a journey.b
2 At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants to obtain from them some of the produce of the vineyard.
3 But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
4 Again he sent them another servant. And that one they beat over the head and treated shamefully.
5 He sent yet another whom they killed. So, too, many others; some they beat, others they killed.
6 He had one other to send, a beloved son. He sent him to them last of all, thinking, ‘They will respect my son.’
7 But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
8 So they seized him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
9 What [then] will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come, put the tenants to death, and give the vineyard to others.
10 Have you not read this scripture passage:c ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
11 by the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes’?”
12 They were seeking to arrest him, but they feared the crowd, for they realized that he had addressed the parable to them. So they left him and went away. Paying Taxes to the Emperor.
13 * They sent some Phariseesd and Herodians to him to ensnare hime in his speech.*
14 They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion. You do not regard a person’s status but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?”
15 Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius to look at.”
16 They brought one to him and he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” They replied to him, “Caesar’s.”
17 So Jesus said to them, “Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.” They were utterly amazed at him.f The Question About the Resurrection.*
18 Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and put this question to him,
19 saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us, ‘If someone’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no child, his brother must take the wife and raise up descendants for his brother.’g
20 Now there were seven brothers. The first married a woman and died, leaving no descendants.
21 So the second married her and died, leaving no descendants, and the third likewise.
22 And the seven left no descendants. Last of all the woman also died.
23 At the resurrection [when they arise] whose wife will she be? For all seven had been married to her.”
24 Jesus said to them, “Are you not misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?
25 When they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like the angels in heaven.
26 As for the dead being raised, have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God told him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, [the] God of Isaac, and [the] God of Jacob’?h
27 He is not God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly misled.” The Greatest Commandment.*
28 One of the scribes,i when he came forward and heard them disputing and saw how well he had answered them, asked him, “Which is the first of all the commandments?”
29 Jesus replied, “The first is this: ‘Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is Lord alone!
30 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’j
31 The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”k
32 The scribe said to him, “Well said, teacher. You are right in saying, ‘He is One and there is no other than he.’
33 And ‘to love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself’ is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”l
34 And when Jesus saw that [he] answered with understanding, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to ask him any more questions.m The Question About David’s Son.*
35 As Jesus was teaching in the temple area he said,n “How do the scribes claim that the Messiah is the son of David?
36 David himself, inspired by the holy Spirit, said: ‘The Lord said to my lord, “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies under your feet.”’o
37 David himself calls him ‘lord’; so how is he his son?” [The] great crowd heard this with delight. Denunciation of the Scribes.*
38 In the course of his teaching he said,p “Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces,
39 seats of honor in synagogues, and places of honor at banquets.
40 They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. They will receive a very severe condemnation.” The Poor Widow’s Contribution.*
41 He sat down opposite the treasury and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury.q Many rich people put in large sums.
42 A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents.
43 Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, “Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury.
44 For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood.”

*** chapter 13 ***

The Destruction of the Temple Foretold.*
1 As he was making his way out of the temple area one of his disciples said to him, “Look, teacher, what stones and what buildings!”a
2 Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be one stone left upon another that will not be thrown down.” The Signs of the End.
3 * As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple area, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,b
4 “Tell us, when will this happen, and what sign will there be when all these things are about to come to an end?”
5 Jesus began to say to them, “See that no one deceives you.c
6 Many will come in my name saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many.
7 When you hear of wars and reports of wars do not be alarmed; such things must happen, but it will not yet be the end.
8 Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes from place to place and there will be famines. These are the beginnings of the labor pains. The Coming Persecution.
9 d “Watch out for yourselves. They will hand you over to the courts. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will be arraigned before governors and kings because of me, as a witness before them.
10 But the gospel must first be preached to all nations.*
11 When they lead you away and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say.e But say whatever will be given to you at that hour. For it will not be you who are speaking but the holy Spirit.
12 Brother will hand over brother to death, and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
13 You will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. The Great Tribulation.
14 f “When you see the desolating abomination standing* where he should not (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains,g
15 [and] a person on a housetop must not go down or enter to get anything out of his house,h
16 and a person in a field must not return to get his cloak.
17 Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days.
18 Pray that this does not happen in winter.
19 For those times will have tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of God’s creation until now, nor ever will be.i
20 If the Lord had not shortened those days, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect whom he chose, he did shorten the days.
21 If anyone says to you then, ‘Look, here is the Messiah! Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.
22 False messiahs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders in order to mislead, if that were possible, the elect.
23 Be watchful! I have told it all to you beforehand. The Coming of the Son of Man.
24 j “But in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,k
25 and the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
26 * l And then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in the clouds’ with great power and glory,
27 and then he will send out the angels and gather [his] elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of the sky. The Lesson of the Fig Tree.
28 m “Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.
29 In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that he is near, at the gates.
30 Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.
31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Need for Watchfulness.
32 “But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
33 n Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come.
34 It is like a man traveling abroad. He leaves home and places his servants in charge, each with his work, and orders the gatekeeper to be on the watch.o
35 Watch, therefore; you do not know when the lord of the house is coming, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or in the morning.
36 May he not come suddenly and find you sleeping.
37 What I say to you, I say to all: ‘Watch!’”

*** chapter 14 ***

The Conspiracy Against Jesus.
1 * The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread* were to take place in two days’ time.a So the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to arrest him by treachery and put him to death.
2 They said, “Not during the festival, for fear that there may be a riot among the people.” The Anointing at Bethany.*
3 When he was in Bethany reclining at table in the house of Simon the leper,b a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil, costly genuine spikenard. She broke the alabaster jar and poured it on his head.
4 There were some who were indignant. “Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil?
5 It could have been sold for more than three hundred days’ wages and the money given to the poor.” They were infuriated with her.
6 Jesus said, “Let her alone. Why do you make trouble for her? She has done a good thing for me.
7 The poor you will always have with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them, but you will not always have me.
8 She has done what she could. She has anticipated anointing my body for burial.
9 Amen, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.” The Betrayal by Judas.
10 c Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went off to the chief priests to hand him over to them.
11 When they heard him they were pleased and promised to pay him money. Then he looked for an opportunity to hand him over. Preparations for the Passover.
12 d On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb,* his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
13 He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city and a man will meet you, carrying a jar of water.* Follow him.
14 Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’
15 Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.”
16 The disciples then went off, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover. The Betrayer.
17 e When it was evening, he came with the Twelve.
18 * And as they reclined at table and were eating, Jesus said, “Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.”
19 They began to be distressed and to say to him, one by one, “Surely it is not I?”
20 He said to them, “One of the Twelve, the one who dips with me into the dish.
21 For the Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,* but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for that man if he had never been born.” The Lord’s Supper.
22 * While they were eating,f he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is my body.”
23 Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
24 He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed* for many.
25 Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
26 Then, after singing a hymn,* they went out to the Mount of Olives.g Peter’s Denial Foretold.*
27 Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will have your faith shaken, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be dispersed.’h
28 But after I have been raised up, I shall go before you to Galilee.”
29 Peter said to him, “Even though all should have their faith shaken, mine will not be.”
30 Then Jesus said to him, “Amen, I say to you, this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times.”
31 But he vehemently replied, “Even though I should have to die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all spoke similarly. The Agony in the Garden.
32 * Then they came to a place named Gethsemane,i and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”j
33 He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be troubled and distressed.
34 Then he said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch.”
35 He advanced a little and fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass by him;
36 he said, “Abba, Father,* all things are possible to you. Take this cup away from me, but not what I will but what you will.”
37 When he returned he found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
38 * Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test.k The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.”
39 Withdrawing again, he prayed, saying the same thing.
40 Then he returned once more and found them asleep, for they could not keep their eyes open and did not know what to answer him.
41 He returned a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.
42 Get up, let us go. See, my betrayer is at hand.” The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus.
43 l Then, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs who had come from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
44 His betrayer had arranged a signal with them, saying, “The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him and lead him away securely.”
45 He came and immediately went over to him and said, “Rabbi.” And he kissed him.
46 At this they laid hands on him and arrested him.
47 One of the bystanders drew his sword, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.
48 Jesus said to them in reply, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to seize me?
49 Day after day I was with you teaching in the temple area, yet you did not arrest me; but that the scriptures may be fulfilled.”
50 And they all left him and fled.
51 Now a young man followed him wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body. They seized him,
52 but he left the cloth behind and ran off naked. Jesus Before the Sanhedrin.
53 * m They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
54 Peter followed him at a distance into the high priest’s courtyard and was seated with the guards, warming himself at the fire.
55 The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they found none.
56 Many gave false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.
57 * Some took the stand and testified falsely against him, alleging,
58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.’”n
59 Even so their testimony did not agree.
60 The high priest rose before the assembly and questioned Jesus, saying, “Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?”
61 * But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, “Are you the Messiah, the son of the Blessed One?”
62 Then Jesus answered, “I am; and ‘you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.’”o
63 At that the high priest tore his garments and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?
64 You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” They all condemned him as deserving to die.
65 Some began to spit on him. They blindfolded him and struck him and said to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards greeted him with blows.p Peter’s Denial of Jesus.
66 q While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s maids came along.
67 Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You too were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
68 * But he denied it saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.” So he went out into the outer court. [Then the cock crowed.]
69 The maid saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”
70 Once again he denied it. A little later the bystanders said to Peter once more, “Surely you are one of them; for you too are a Galilean.”
71 He began to curse and to swear, “I do not know this man about whom you are talking.”
72 And immediately a cock crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times.” He broke down and wept.r

*** chapter 15 ***

Jesus Before Pilate.
1 a As soon as morning came,b the chief priests with the elders and the scribes, that is, the whole Sanhedrin, held a council.* They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.
2 Pilate questioned him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”* He said to him in reply, “You say so.”
3 The chief priests accused him of many things.
4 Again Pilate questioned him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of.”
5 Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed. The Sentence of Death.*
6 Now on the occasion of the feast he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested.c
7 A man called Barabbas* was then in prison along with the rebels who had committed murder in a rebellion.
8 The crowd came forward and began to ask him to do for them as he was accustomed.
9 Pilate answered, “Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?”
10 For he knew that it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed him over.
11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.
12 Pilate again said to them in reply, “Then what [do you want] me to do with [the man you call] the king of the Jews?”
13 * They shouted again, “Crucify him.”
14 Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?” They only shouted the louder, “Crucify him.”
15 * So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged, handed him over to be crucified. Mockery by the Soldiers.
16 * d The soldiers led him away inside the palace, that is, the praetorium, and assembled the whole cohort.
17 They clothed him in purple and, weaving a crown of thorns, placed it on him.
18 They began to salute him with, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
19 and kept striking his head with a reed and spitting upon him. They knelt before him in homage.
20 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him out to crucify him. The Way of the Cross.
21 They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian,* who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.e The Crucifixion.
22 f They brought him to the place of Golgotha (which is translated Place of the Skull).
23 They gave him wine drugged with myrrh, but he did not take it.
24 * g Then they crucified him and divided his garments by casting lots for them to see what each should take.
25 It was nine o’clock in the morning* when they crucified him.
26 * The inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.”
27 With him they crucified two revolutionaries, one on his right and one on his left.h 
28 *
29 * Those passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying,i “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
30 save yourself by coming down from the cross.”
31 Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes, mocked him among themselves and said, “He saved others; he cannot save himself.
32 Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also kept abusing him.j The Death of Jesus.
33 At noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
34 And at three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”* which is translated, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”k
35 * Some of the bystanders who heard it said, “Look, he is calling Elijah.”
36 One of them ran, soaked a sponge with wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.”
37 Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.
38 * The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.
39 * l When the centurion who stood facing him saw how he breathed his last he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
40 * There were also women looking on from a distance.m Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome.
41 These women had followed him when he was in Galilee and ministered to him. There were also many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem. The Burial of Jesus.
42 n When it was already evening, since it was the day of preparation, the day before the sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimathea,* a distinguished member of the council, who was himself awaiting the kingdom of God, came and courageously went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
44 Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died.
45 And when he learned of it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
46 Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses watched where he was laid.

*** chapter 16 ***

The Resurrection of Jesus.*
1 When the sabbath was over,a Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him.b
2 Very early when the sun had risen, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb.
3 They were saying to one another, “Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”
4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back; it was very large.
5 On entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed.c
6 He said to them, “Do not be amazed! You seek Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him.
7 But go and tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’”d
8 Then they went out and fled from the tomb, seized with trembling and bewilderment. They said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. The Appearance to Mary Magdalene. [
9 e When he had risen, early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.
10 f She went and told his companions who were mourning and weeping.
11 When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe. The Appearance to Two Disciples.
12 g After this he appeared in another form to two of them walking along on their way to the country.
13 They returned and told the others; but they did not believe them either. The Commissioning of the Eleven.
14 h [But] later, as the eleven were at table, he appeared to them and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not believed those who saw him after he had been raised.
15 i He said to them, “Go into the whole world and proclaim the gospel to every creature.
16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever does not believe will be condemned.
17 These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons, they will speak new languages.
18 They will pick up serpents [with their hands], and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”j The Ascension of Jesus.
19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.k
20 But they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through accompanying signs.]l [And they reported all the instructions briefly to Peter’s companions. Afterwards Jesus himself, through them, sent forth from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.]
