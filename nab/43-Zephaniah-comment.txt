*** the book of Zephaniah ***
*** chapter 1 ***

* [1:1] Hezekiah: it is possible, but not certain, that Zephaniah’s ancestor was King Hezekiah who reigned in Judah from 715 to 687 B.C. (2 Kgs 18–20).
* [1:5] The host of heaven: the sun, moon, planets, and stars, the worship of which became widespread in Judah under Assyrian influence. Milcom: the god of the Ammonites; cf. 1 Kgs 11:5, 7, 33; 2 Kgs 23:13.
* [1:7] He has consecrated his guests: God has consecrated the troops, presumably foreign, who have been invited to share in the spoil on the day of slaughter.
* [1:9] Leap over the threshold: the reference may be to a religious ritual like that practiced by the priests of the Philistine deity Dagon (1 Sm 5:5).
* [1:10–11] The Second Quarter…Maktesh: sections of Jerusalem (cf. 2 Kgs 22:14).
* [1:12] Settle like dregs in wine: those who are overconfident because, like the sediment that settles to the bottom of a bottle of wine, they have remained at peace and undisturbed for a long time.

*** chapter 2 ***

* [2:1–3] This oracle is a classic description of the day of the Lord as an overwhelming disaster, concluding with a call for repentance and reform. Nation without shame: Judah.
* [2:4] Gaza…Ashkelon…Ashdod…Ekron: cities of the Philistine confederation.
* [2:5] Cherethites: a synonym for, or subgroup of, the Philistines, which may be associated with Crete, a part of the larger Aegean area from which the Philistines came.
* [2:8] Moab…Ammonites: Judah’s neighbors to the East across the Jordan.
* [2:12] Cushites: the Ethiopians, who had ruled Egypt a generation before Zephaniah’s career.
* [2:15] The exultant city: Nineveh. Hiss, and shake their fists: gestures of derision.

*** chapter 3 ***

* [3:1] The tyrannical city: Jerusalem.
