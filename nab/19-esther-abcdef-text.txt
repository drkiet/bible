Dream of Mordecai.
1 In the second year of the reign of Ahasuerus the great, on the first day of Nisan, Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream.* a
2 * He was a Jew residing in the city of Susa, a prominent man who served at the king’s court,
3 and one of the captives whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken from Jerusalem with Jeconiah, king of Judah.b

4 c This was his dream.* There was noise and tumult, thunder and earthquake—confusion upon the earth.
5 Two great dragons advanced, both poised for combat. They uttered a mighty cry,
6 and at their cry every nation prepared for war, to fight against the nation of the just.
7 It was a dark and gloomy day. Tribulation and distress, evil and great confusion, lay upon the earth.
8 The whole nation of the just was shaken with fear at the evils to come upon them, and they expected to perish.
9 d Then they cried out to God, and from their crying there arose, as though from a tiny spring, a mighty river, a flood of water.
10 The light of the sun broke forth; the lowly were exalted and they devoured the boastful.

11 Having seen this dream and what God intended to do, Mordecai awoke. He kept it in mind, and tried in every way, until night, to understand its meaning.

Mordecai Thwarts an Assassination.*
12 e Mordecai lodged in the courtyard with Bigthan and Teresh, two eunuchs of the king who guarded the courtyard.
13 He overheard them plotting, investigated their plans, and discovered that they were preparing to assassinate King Ahasuerus. So he informed the king about them.
14 The king had the two eunuchs questioned and, upon their confession, put to death.
15 Then the king had these things recorded; Mordecai, too, put them into writing.
16 The king also appointed Mordecai to serve at the court, and rewarded him for his actions.f

17 Haman, however, son of Hammedatha, a Bougean,* who was held in high honor by the king, sought to harm Mordecai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.g

*** chapter B ***

1 This is a copy of the letter: “The great King Ahasuerus writes to the satraps of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia, and the governors subordinate to them, as follows:
2 When I came to rule many peoples and to hold sway over the whole world, not being carried away by a sense of my own authority but always acting fairly and with mildness, I determined to provide for my subjects a life of lasting tranquility; and, by making my kingdom civilized and safe for travel to its farthest borders, to restore the peace desired by all people.a
3 When I consulted my counselors as to how this might be accomplished, Haman, who excels among us in discretion, who is outstanding for constant good will and steadfast loyalty, and who has gained a place in the kingdom second only to me,b
4 brought it to our attention that, mixed among all the nations throughout the world, there is one people of ill will, which by its laws is opposed to every other people and continually disregards the decrees of kings, so that the unity of empire blamelessly designed by us cannot be established.c

5 “Having noted, therefore, that this nation, and it alone, is continually at variance with all people, lives by divergent and alien laws, is inimical to our government, and does all the harm it can to undermine the stability of the kingdom,
6 we hereby decree that all those who are indicated to you in the letters of Haman, who is in charge of the administration and is a second father to us, shall, together with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the swords of their enemies, without any pity or mercy, on the fourteenth day* of the twelfth month, Adar, of the current year;d
7 so that when these people, whose present ill will is of long standing, have gone down into Hades by a violent death on a single day, they may leave our government completely stable and undisturbed for the future.”

Prayer of Mordecai.
1 Recalling all that the Lord had done, Mordecai prayed to the Lord
2 and said: “Lord, Lord, King and Ruler of all, everything is in your power, and there is no one to oppose you when it is your will to save Israel.
3 You made heaven and earth and every wonderful thing under heaven.
4 You are Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist you, the Lord.
5 a You know all things. You know, Lord, that it was not out of insolence or arrogance or desire for glory that I acted thus in not bowing down to the arrogant Haman.
6 I would have gladly kissed the soles of his feet for the salvation of Israel.
7 But I acted as I did so as not to place the honor of a mortal above that of God. I will not bow down to anyone but you, my Lord. It is not out of arrogance that I am acting thus.
8 And now, Lord God, King, God of Abraham, spare your people, for our enemies regard us with deadly envy and are bent upon destroying the inheritance that was yours from the beginning.
9 Do not spurn your portion, which you redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt.
10 Hear my prayer; have pity on your inheritance and turn our mourning into feasting, that we may live to sing praise to your name, Lord. Do not silence the mouths of those who praise you.”
11 All Israel, too, cried out with all their strength, for death was staring them in the face.

Prayer of Esther.
12 b Queen Esther, seized with mortal anguish, fled to the Lord for refuge.
13 Taking off her splendid garments, she put on garments of distress and mourning. In place of her precious ointments she covered her head with dung and ashes. She afflicted her body severely and in place of her festive adornments, her tangled hair covered her.

14 Then she prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: “My Lord, you alone are our King. Help me, who am alone and have no help but you,
15 for I am taking my life in my hand.c
16 From birth, I have heard among my people that you, Lord, chose Israel from among all nations, and our ancestors from among all their forebears, as a lasting inheritance, and that you fulfilled all your promises to them.d
17 But now we have sinned in your sight, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies,
18 because we worshiped their gods. You are just, O Lord.
19 But now they are not satisfied with our bitter servitude, but have sworn an oath to their idols
20 to do away with the decree you have pronounced, to destroy your inheritance, to close the mouths of those who praise you, to extinguish the glory of your house and your altar,
21 to open the mouths of the nations to acclaim their worthless gods, and to extol a mortal king forever.

22 “Lord, do not relinquish your scepter to those who are nothing. Do not let our foes gloat over our ruin, but turn their own counsel against them and make an example of the one who began this against us.
23 Be mindful of us, Lord. Make yourself known in the time of our distress and give me courage, King of gods and Ruler of every power.
24 Put in my mouth persuasive words in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to hatred for our enemy, so that he and his co-conspirators may perish.
25 Save us by your power, and help me, who am alone and have no one but you, Lord.

26 “You know all things. You know that I hate the pomp of the lawless, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised or of any foreigner.
27 You know that I am under constraint, that I abhor the sign of grandeur that rests on my head when I appear in public. I abhor it like a polluted rag, and do not wear it in private.
28 I, your servant, have never eaten at the table of Haman, nor have I graced the banquet of the king or drunk the wine of libations.*
29 From the day I was brought here till now, your servant has had no joy except in you, Lord, God of Abraham.
30 O God, whose power is over all, hear the voice of those in despair. Save us from the power of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear.”

Esther Goes to Ahasuerus.*
1 On the third day, ending her prayers, she took off her prayer garments and arrayed herself in her splendid attire.
2 In making her appearance, after invoking the all-seeing God and savior, she took with her two maids;
3 on the one she leaned gently for support,
4 while the other followed her, bearing her train.
5 She glowed with perfect beauty and her face was as joyous as it was lovely, though her heart was pounding with fear.
6 She passed through all the portals till she stood before the king, who was seated on his royal throne, clothed in full robes of state, and covered with gold and precious stones, so that he inspired great awe.
7 As he looked up in extreme anger, his features fiery and majestic, the queen staggered, turned pale and fainted, collapsing against the maid in front of her.
8 But God changed the king’s anger to gentleness. In great anxiety he sprang from his throne, held her in his arms until she recovered, and comforted her with reassuring words.
9 “What is it, Esther?” he said to her. “I am your brother.* Take courage!
10 You shall not die; this order of ours applies only to our subjects.
11 Come near!”
12 Raising the golden scepter, he touched her neck with it, embraced her, and said, “Speak to me.”a
13 She replied: “I saw you, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was shaken by fear of your majesty.
14 For you are awesome, my lord, though your countenance is full of mercy.”
15 As she said this, she fainted.
16 The king was shaken and all his attendants tried to revive her.

*** chapter E ***

1 The following is a copy of the letter: “The great King Ahasuerus to the governors of the provinces in the hundred and twenty-seven satrapies from India to Ethiopia, and to those who are loyal to our government: Greetings!
2 “Many have become more ambitious the more they were showered with honors through the bountiful generosity of their patrons.
3 Not only do they seek to do harm to our subjects but, incapable of dealing with such greatness, they even begin plotting against their own benefactors.
4 Not only do they drive out gratitude from among humankind but, with the arrogant boastfulness of those to whom goodness has no meaning, they suppose they will escape the stern judgment of the all-seeing God.
5 “Often, too, the fair speech of friends entrusted with the administration of affairs has induced many placed in authority to become accomplices in the shedding of innocent blood, and has involved them in irreparable calamities
6 by deceiving with malicious slander the sincere good will of rulers.
7 This can be verified in the ancient stories that have been handed down to us, but more fully when you consider the wicked deeds perpetrated in your midst by the pestilential influence of those undeserving of authority.
8 a We must provide for the future, so as to render the kingdom undisturbed and peaceful for all people,
9 taking advantage of changing conditions and always deciding matters coming to our attention with equitable treatment.
10 “For instance, Haman, son of Hammedatha, a Macedonian,* certainly not of Persian blood, and very different from us in generosity, was hospitably received by us.
11 He benefited so much from the good will we have toward all peoples that he was proclaimed ‘our father,’ before whom everyone was to bow down; and he attained a position second only to the royal throne.b
12 But, unable to control his arrogance, he strove to deprive us of kingdom and of life,
13 and by weaving intricate webs of deceit he demanded the destruction of Mordecai, our savior and constant benefactor, and of Esther, our blameless royal consort, together with their whole nation.c
14 For by such measures he hoped to catch us defenseless and to transfer the rule of the Persians to the Macedonians.
15 But we find that the Jews, who were doomed to extinction by this archcriminal, are not evildoers, but rather are governed by very just laws
16 and are the children of the Most High, the living God of majesty, who has maintained the kingdom in a flourishing condition for us and for our forebears.
17 “You will do well, then, to ignore the letter sent by Haman, son of Hammedatha,
18 for he who composed it has been impaled, together with his entire household, before the gates of Susa. Thus swiftly has God, who governs all, brought just punishment upon him.d
19 “You shall exhibit a copy of this letter publicly in every place to certify that the Jews may follow their own laws
20 and that you may help them on the day set for their ruin, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, to defend themselves against those who attack them.
21 For God, the ruler of all, has turned that day from one of destruction of the chosen people into one of joy for them.
22 Therefore, you too must celebrate this memorable day among your designated feasts with all rejoicing,
23 so that both now and in the future it may be a celebration of deliverance for us and for Persians of good will, but for those who plot against us a reminder of destruction.
24 “Every city and province without exception that does not observe this decree shall be ruthlessly destroyed with fire and sword, so that it will be left not merely untrodden by people, but even shunned by wild beasts and birds forever.”e

Mordecai’s Dream Fulfilled.
1 a Then Mordecai said: “This is the work of God.
2 I recall the dream I had about these very things, and not a single detail has been left unfulfilled—
3 the tiny spring that grew into a river, and there was light, and sun, and many waters. The river is Esther, whom the king married and made queen.
4 The two dragons are myself and Haman.
5 The nations are those who assembled to destroy the name of the Jews,
6 but my people is Israel, who cried to God and was saved. “The Lord saved his people and delivered us from all these evils. God worked signs and great wonders, such as have not occurred among the nations.
7 For this purpose he arranged two lots:* one for the people of God, the second for all the other nations.
8 These two lots were fulfilled in the hour, the time, and the day of judgment before God and among all the nations.
9 God remembered his people and rendered justice to his inheritance.

10 b “Gathering together with joy and happiness before God, they shall celebrate these days on the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month Adar throughout all future generations of his people Israel.”

Colophon.*
11 In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and his son Ptolemy brought the present letter of Purim, saying that it was genuine and that Lysimachus, son of Ptolemy, of the community of Jerusalem, had translated it.
