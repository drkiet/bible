*** the book of Prophecy Of Abdias _Obadiah_ ***

*** chapter 1 ***

12 "Thou shalt not look": or, thou shouldst not, etc. It is a reprehension for what they had done, and at the same time a declaration that these things should not pass unpunished.-- Ibid.
12 "Thou shalt not magnify thy mouth": That is, thou shalt not speak arrogantly against the children of Juda as insulting them in their distress.
