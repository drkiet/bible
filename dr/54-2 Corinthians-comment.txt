*** the book of Second Epistle Of Saint Paul To The Corinthians ***

*** chapter 1 ***

19 "It is, was in him": There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the apostles, sometimes, like modern sectaries, saying, It is, and at other times saying, It is not. But their doctrine was ever the same, one uniform yea, in Jesus Christ, one Amen, that is, one truth in him.

*** chapter 2 ***

10 "I also": The apostle here granted an indulgence, or pardon, in the person and by the authority of Christ, to the incestuous Corinthian, whom before he had put under penance, which pardon consisted in a releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin.
16 "The odour of death": The preaching of the apostle, which by its fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call.

*** chapter 3 ***

6 "The letter": Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit.

*** chapter 4 ***


*** chapter 5 ***

10 "The proper things of the body": In the particular judgment, immediately after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.
16 "We know no man according to the flesh": That is, we consider not any man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God. The apostle adds, that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.
21 "Sin for us": That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin.

*** chapter 7 ***


*** chapter 8 ***

2 "Simplicity": That is, sincere bounty and charity.

*** chapter 9 ***


*** chapter 10 ***


*** chapter 11 ***

1 "My folly": So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to his charge.
28 "My daily instance": The labours that come in, and press upon me every day.

*** chapter 12 ***

9 "Power is made perfect": The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.

*** chapter 13 ***

7 "Reprobates": that is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing our power in punishing you.
