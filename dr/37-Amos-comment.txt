*** the book of Prophecy Of Amos ***

*** chapter 1 ***

1 "The earthquake": Many understand this of a great earthquake, which they say was felt at the time that king Ozias attempted to offer incense in the temple. But the best chronologists prove that the earthquake here spoken of must have been before that time: because Jeroboam the second, under whom Amos prophesied, was dead long before that attempt of Ozias.
3 "For three crimes": That is, for their many unrepented of crimes.-- Ibid.
3 "I will not convert it": That is, I will not spare them, nor turn away the punishments I design to inflict upon them.
15 "Melchom": The god or idol of the Ammonites, otherwise called Moloch, and Melech: which in Hebrew signifies a king, and Melchom their king.

*** chapter 2 ***

13 "I will screak": Unable to bear any longer the enormous load of your sins, etc. The spirit of God, as St. Jerome takes notice, accommodates himself to the education of the prophet and inspires him with comparisons taken from country affairs.

*** chapter 3 ***

2 "Visit upon": That is, punish.
6 "Evil in a city": He speaks of the evil of punishments of war, famine, pestilence, desolation, etc., but not of the evil of sin, of which God is not the author.

*** chapter 4 ***

1 "Fat kine": He means the great ones that lived in plenty and wealth.
3 "Armon": A foreign country; some understand it of Armenia.

*** chapter 5 ***

5 "But seek not Bethel": Bethel, Galgal, Bersabee: the places where they worshipped their idols.
8 "Arcturus and Orion": Arcturus is a bright star in the north: Orion a beautiful constellation in the south.
9 "With a smile": That is, with all ease, and without making any effort.
25 "Did you offer": Except the sacrifices that were offered at the first, in the dedication of the tabernacle, the Israelites offered no sacrifices in the desert.
26 "A tabernacle": All this alludes to the idolatry which they committed, when they were drawn away by the daughters of Moab to the worship of their gods. Num. 25.

*** chapter 6 ***


*** chapter 7 ***

1 "The locust": These judgments by locusts and fire, which, by the prophet's intercession, were moderated, signify the former invasions of the Assyrians under Phul and Theglathphalasar, before the utter desolation of Israel by Salmanasar.
11 "Jeroboam shall die by the sword": The prophet did not say this; but that the Lord would rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword: which was verified, when Zacharias, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was slain by the sword. 4 Kings 15. 10.
14 "I am not a prophet": That is, I am not a prophet by education: nor is prophesying my calling or profession: but I am a herdsman, whom God was pleased to send hither to prophesy to Israel.
16 "The house of the idol": Viz., of the calf worshipped in Bethel.

*** chapter 8 ***


*** chapter 9 ***

6 "His ascension": That is, his high throne.-- Ibid.
6 "His bundle": That is, his church bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion.
7 "As the children of the Ethiopians": That is, as black as they, by your iniquities.
13 "Shall overtake": By this is meant the great abundance of spiritual blessings; which, as it were, by a constant succession, shall enrich the church of Christ.
