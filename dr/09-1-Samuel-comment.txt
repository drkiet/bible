*** the book of First Book Of Kings _1 Samuel_ ***

*** chapter 1 ***

1 "An Ephraimite": He was of the tribe of Levi, 1. Par. 6. 34, but is called an Ephraimite from dwelling in mount Ephraim.
20 "Samuel": This name imports, asked of God.

*** chapter 2 ***

1 "My horn": The horn in the scriptures signifies strength, power, the horn is said to be exalted, when a person receives an increase of strength or glory.
25 "Who shall pray for him": By this word Heli would have his sons understand, that by their wicked abuse of sacred things, and of the very sacrifices which were appointed to appease the Lord, they deprived themselves of the ordinary means of reconciliation with God; which was by sacrifices. The more, because they were the chief priests whose business it was to intercede for all others, they had no other to offer sacrifices and to make atonement for them. Ibid.
25 "Because the Lord would slay them": In consequence of their manifold sacrileges, he would not soften their hearts with his efficacious grace, but was determined to destroy them.
32 "Thy rival": A priest of another race. This was partly fulfilled, when Abiathar, of the race of Heli, was removed from the priesthood, and Sadoc, who was of another line, was substituted in his place. But it was more fully accomplished in the New Testament, when the priesthood of Aaron gave place to that of Christ.

*** chapter 3 ***

1 "Precious": That is, rare.

*** chapter 4 ***

1 "The Stone of help": In Hebrew Eben-ezer; so called from the help which the Lord was pleased afterwards to give to his people Israel in that place, by the prayers of Samuel, chap. 7. 12.
18 "Named the ark": There is great reason, by all these circumstances, to hope that Heli died in a state of grace; and by his temporal punishments escaped the eternal.
21 "Ichabod": That is, Where is the glory? or, there is no glory. We see how much the Israelites lamented the loss of the ark, which was but the symbol of God's presence among them. How much more ought Christians to lament the loss of God himself, when by sin they have driven him out of their souls.

*** chapter 5 ***


*** chapter 6 ***

19 "Seen": And curiously looked into. It is likely this plague reached to all the neighbouring country, as well as the city of Bethsames.

*** chapter 7 ***

1 "In Gabaa": That is, on the hill, for Gabaa signifieth a hill.

*** chapter 8 ***

7 "Rejected": The government of Israel hitherto had been a theocracy, in which God himself immediately ruled, by laws which he had enacted, and by judges extraordinarily raised up by himself; and therefore he complains that his people rejected him, in desiring a change of government.
9 "The right": That is, the manner (misphat) after which he shall proceed, having no one to control him, when he has the power in his hand.

*** chapter 9 ***

9 "Seer": Because of his seeing by divine light hidden things and things to come.
12 "A sacrifice": The law did not allow of sacrifices in any other place, but at the tabernacle, or temple, in which the ark of the covenant was kept; but Samuel, by divine dispensation, offered sacrifices in other places. For which dispensation this reason may be alleged, that the house of God in Silo, having lost the ark, was now cast off; as a figure of the reprobation of the Jews, Ps. 77. 60, 67. And in Cariathiarim where the ark was, there was neither tabernacle, nor altar.-- Ibid.
12 "The high place": Excelsum. The excelsa, or high places, so often mentioned in scripture, were places of worship, in which were altars for sacrifice. These were sometimes employed in the service of the true God, as in the present case: but more frequently in the service of idols; and were called excelsa, which is commonly (though perhaps not so accurately) rendered high places; not because they were always upon hills, for the very worst of all, which was that of Topheth, or Geennom, (Jer. 19.) was in a valley; but because of the high altars, and pillars, or monuments, erected there, on which were set up the idols, or images of their deities.

*** chapter 10 ***

3 "Bethel": Where there was at that time an altar of God; it being one of the places where Samuel judged Israel.
5 "The hill of God": Gabaa, in which there was also at that time, a high place or altar.
5 "Prophets": These were men whose office it was to sing hymns and praises to God; for such in holy writ are called prophets, and their singing praises to God is called prophesying. See 1 Par. alias 1 Chr. 15. 22, and 25. 1. Now there were in those days colleges, or schools for training up these prophets; and it seems there was one of these schools at this hill of God; and another at Najoth in Ramatha. See 1 Kings 19. 20, 21, etc.
8 "Galgal": Here also by dispensation was an altar of God.
12 "Their father": That is, their teacher, or superior. As much as to say, Who could bring about such a wonderful change as to make Saul a prophet?

*** chapter 11 ***


*** chapter 12 ***

11 "Jerobaal and Badan": That is, Gedeon and Samson called here Badan or Bedan, because he was of Dan.
17 "Wheat harvest": At which time of the year, it never thunders or rains in those countries.

*** chapter 13 ***

1 "Of one year": That is, he was good and like an innocent child, and for two years continued in that innocency.

*** chapter 14 ***

10 "This shall be a sign": It is likely Jonathan was instructed by divine inspiration to make a choice of this sign: otherwise the observation of omens is superstitious and sinful.
42 "Jonathan was taken": Though Jonathan was excused from sin, through ignorance of the prohibition, yet God was pleased on this occasion to let the lot fall upon him, to shew unto all the great obligation of obedience to princes and parents.

*** chapter 15 ***

3 "Child": The great Master of life and death (who cuts off one half of all mankind whilst they are children) has been pleased sometimes to ordain that children should be put to the sword, in detestation of the crimes of their parents, and that they might not live to follow the same wicked ways. But without such ordinance of God it is not allowable, in any wars, how just soever, to kill children.
35 "Saw Saul no more till the day of his death": That is, he went no more to see him: he visited him no more.

*** chapter 16 ***

14 "From the Lord": An evil spirit, by divine permission, and for his punishment, either possessed or obsessed him.
23 "Departed from him": Chased away by David's devotion.

*** chapter 17 ***


*** chapter 18 ***

10 "Prophesied": Acted the prophet in a mad manner.

*** chapter 19 ***

18 "Najoth": It was probably a school or college of prophets, in or near Ramath under the direction of Samuel.
20 "Prophesying": That is, singing praises to God by a divine impulse. God was pleased on this occasion that both Samuel's messengers and himself should experience the like impulse, that he might understand, by this instance of the divine power, how vain are the designs of man against him whom God protects.

*** chapter 20 ***

5 "Tomorrow is the new moon": The neomenia, or first day of the moon, kept according to the law, as a festival; and therefore Saul feasted on that day: and expected the attendance of his family.
15 "May he take away Jonathan": It is a curse upon himself, if he should not be faithful to his promise.-- Ibid.
15 "Require it": That is, revenge it upon David's enemies, and upon me, if I should fail of my word given to him.
31 "The son of death": That is, one that deserveth death, and shall surely be put to death.

*** chapter 21 ***

1 "Nobe": A city in the tribe of Benjamin, to which the tabernacle of the Lord had been translated from Silo.
4 "If the young men be clean": If this cleanness was required of them that were to eat that bread, which was a figure of the bread of life which we receive in the blessed sacrament; how clean ought Christians to be when they approach to our tremendous mysteries. And what reason hath the church of God to admit none to be her ministers to consecrate and daily receive this most pure sacrament, but such as devote themselves to a life of perpetual purity.
5 "The vessels": i. e., the bodies, have been holy, that is, have been kept from impurity.-- Ibid.
5 "Is defiled": Is liable to expose us to dangers of uncleanness.-- Ibid.
5 "Be sanctified": That is, we shall take care, notwithstanding these dangerous circumstances, to keep our vessels holy, that is, to keep our bodies from every thing that may defile us.

*** chapter 22 ***

4 "The hold": The strong hold, or fortress of Maspha.

*** chapter 23 ***

6 "An ephod": Or the ephod. That is, the vestment of the high priest, with the urim and thummim, by which the Lord gave his oracle.

*** chapter 24 ***

6 "Heart struck him": Viz., with remorse, as fearing he had done amiss.
11 "A thought to kill thee": That is, a suggestion, to which I did not consent.
13 "Revenge me of thee": Or, as it is in the Hebrew, will revenge me. The meaning is, that he refers his whole cause to God, to judge and punish according to his justice: yet so as to keep himself in the mean time, from all personal hatred to Saul, or desire of gratifying his own passion, by seeking revenge. So far from it, that when Saul was afterwards slain, we find, that instead of rejoicing at his death, he mourned most bitterly for him.

*** chapter 25 ***

22 "If I leave": David certainly sinned in his designs against Nabal and his family, as he himself was afterwards sensible, when he blessed God for hindering him from executing the revenge he had proposed.
25 "His name": Nabal, in Hebrew, signifies a fool.
39 "Blessed be": David praiseth God, on this occasion, not out of joy for the death of Nabal (which would have argued a rancour of heart), but because he saw that God had so visibly taken his cause in hand, in punishing the injury done to him; whilst, by a merciful providence he kept him from revenging himself.

*** chapter 26 ***


*** chapter 27 ***

8 "Pillaged Gessuri": These probably were enemies of the people of God: and some, if not all of them, were of the number of those whom God had ordered to be destroyed: which justifies David's proceedings in their regard. Though it is to be observed here, that we are not under an obligation of justifying every thing that he did: for the scripture, in relating what was done, does not say that it was well done. And even such as are true servants of God, are not to be imitated in all they do.

*** chapter 28 ***

14 "Understood that it was Samuel": It is the more common opinion of the holy fathers, and interpreters, that the soul of Samuel appeared indeed: and not, as some have imagined, an evil spirit in his shape. Not that the power of her magic could bring him thither, but that God was pleased for the punishment of Saul, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the evils that were falling upon him. See Eccli. 46. 23.
19 "With me": That is, in the state of the dead, and in another world, though not in the same place.
