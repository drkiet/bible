*** the book of Second Epistle Of Saint Paul To Timothy ***

*** chapter 2 ***


*** chapter 3 ***

8 "Jannes and Mambres": The magicians of king Pharao.
16 "All scripture,": Every part of divine scripture is certainly profitable for all these ends. But, if we would have the whole rule of Christian faith and practice, we must not be content with those Scriptures, which Timothy knew from his infancy, that is, with the Old Testament alone: nor yet with the New Testament, without taking along with it the traditions of the apostles, and the interpretation of the church, to which the apostles delivered both the book, and the true meaning of it.

5 "An evangelist": a diligent preacher of the gospel.
