*** the book of First Epistle Of Saint Paul To Timothy ***

*** chapter 1 ***

9 "The law is not": He means, that the just man doth good, and avoideth evil, not as compelled by the law, and merely for fear of the punishment appointed for transgressors; but voluntarily, and out of the love of God and virtue; and would do so, though there were no law.

*** chapter 2 ***

5 "One mediator": Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption, who gave himself, as the apostle writes in the following verse.
6 "a redemption for all": He is also the only mediator, who stands in need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father. But this is not against our seeking the prayers and intercession, as well of the faithful upon earth, as of the saints and angels in heaven, for obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ.

*** chapter 3 ***

2 "Of one wife": The meaning is not that every bishop should have a wife (for St. Paul himself had none), but that no one should be admitted to the holy orders of bishop, priest, or deacon, who had been married more than once.
6 "A neophyte": That is, one lately baptized, a young convert.
15 "The pillar and ground of the truth": Therefore the church of the living God can never uphold error, nor bring in corruptions, superstition, or idolatry.

*** chapter 4 ***

3 "Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats": He speaks of the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Eneratites, the Manicheans, and other ancient heretics, who absolutely condemned marriage, and the use of all kind of meat; because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil principle. Whereas the church of God, so far from condemning marriage, holds it a holy sacrament; and forbids it to none but such as by vow have chosen the better part: and prohibits not the use of any meats whatsoever in proper times and seasons; though she does not judge all kind of diet proper for days of fasting and penance.

*** chapter 5 ***

12 "Their first faith": Their vow, by which they had engaged themselves to Christ.

*** chapter 6 ***
