*** the book of Prophecy Of Nahum ***

*** chapter 1 ***

8 "Of the place thereof": Viz., of Ninive.
11 "Shall come forth one": Some understand this of Sennacherib. But as his attempt against the people seems to have been prior to the prophecy of Nahum, we may better understand it of Holofernes.
12 "Though they were perfect": That is, however strong or numerous their forces may be, they shall be cut off; and their prince or leader shall pass away and disappear.
14 "Will give a commandment": That is, a decree, concerning thee, O king of Ninive, thy seed shall fail, etc.
15 "Belial": The wicked one, viz., the Assyrian.

*** chapter 2 ***

2 "Hath rendered the pride of Jacob": He hath punished Jacob for his pride; and therefore Ninive must not expect to escape. Or else, rendering the pride of Jacob means rewarding, that is, punishing Ninive for the pride they exercised against Jacob.
3 "Of his mighty men": He speaks of the Chaldeans and Medes sent to destroy Ninive.-- Ibid.
3 "Stupefied": consopiti. That is, they drive on furiously like men intoxicated with wine.
5 "Stumble in their march": By running hastily on.

*** chapter 3 ***

8 "Populous Alexandria": No-Ammon. A populous city of Egypt destroyed by the Chaldeans, and afterwards rebuilt by Alexander, and called Alexandria. Others suppose No-Ammon to be the same as Diospolis.
17 "Locusts of locusts": The young locusts.
