*** chapter 4 ***

1 "Unto the end": Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcometh: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.-- Ibid.
1 "In verses": in carminibus. In the Hebrew, it is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.-- Ibid.
1 "For David": That is, inspired to David himself, or to be sung.

*** chapter 5 ***

1 "For her that obtaineth the inheritance": That is, for the church of Christ.

*** chapter 6 ***

1 "For the octave": That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings. St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life: and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth.

*** chapter 7 ***

14 "For them that burn": That is, against the persecutors of his saints.

*** chapter 8 ***

1 "The presses": In Hebrew, Gittith, supposed to be a musical instrument.

*** chapter 9 ***

1 "The hidden things of the Son": The humility and sufferings of Christ, the Son of God; and of good Christians, who are his sons by adoption; are called hidden things, with regard to the children of this world, who know not the value and merit of them.

*** chapter 13 ***


*** chapter 14 ***


*** chapter 15 ***

1 "The inscription of a title": That is, of a pillar or monument, staylographia: which is as much as to say, that this psalm is most worthy to be engraved on an everlasting monument.

*** chapter 16 ***

10 "Their fat": That is, their bowels of compassion: for they have none for me.
14 "Divide them from the few": That is, cut them off from the earth, and the few trifling things thereof; which they are so proud of, or divide them from the few; that is, from thy elect, who are but few; that they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them. It is not meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but, as many other the like passages in the psalms, by way of a prediction, or prophecy of what should come upon them, in punishment of their wickedness. Ibid.
14 "Thy hidden stores": Thy secret treasures, out of which thou furnishest those earthly goods, which, with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed both to the good and the bad.

*** chapter 17 ***


*** chapter 18 ***


*** chapter 19 ***

7 "The salvation of his right hand is in powers": That is, in strength. His right hand is strong and mighty to save them that trust in him.

*** chapter 20 ***

13 "In thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face": Or thou shalt set thy remnants against their faces. That is, thou shalt make them see what punishments remain for them hereafter from thy justice. Instead of remnants, St. Jerome renders it funes, that is, cords or strings, viz., of the bow of divine justice, from which God directs his arrows against the faces of his enemies.

*** chapter 21 ***

2 "The words of my sins": That is, the sins of the world, which I have taken upon myself, cry out against me, and are the cause of all my sufferings.

*** chapter 22 ***

1 "Ruleth me": In Hebrew, Is my shepherd, viz., to feed, guide, and govern me.

*** chapter 23 ***


*** chapter 24 ***


*** chapter 25 ***


*** chapter 26 ***


*** chapter 27 ***


*** chapter 28 ***

6 "Shall reduce them to pieces": In Hebrew, shall make them to skip like a calf. The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder (which he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest and strongest trees; and makes their broken branches skip, etc. All this is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of God's word in his church; which has broken the pride of the great ones of this world, and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their necks to the sweet yoke of Christ.

*** chapter 29 ***


*** chapter 30 ***


*** chapter 31 ***

3 "Because I was silent": That is, whilst I kept silence, by concealing, or refusing to confess my sins, thy hand was heavy upon me, etc.
4 "I am turned": That is, I turn and roll about in my bed to seek for ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh, and sticks fast in me. Or, I am turned: that is, I am converted to thee, my God, by being brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements. In the Hebrew it is, my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer.

*** chapter 32 ***

*** chapter 34 ***


*** chapter 35 ***

3 "Unto hatred": That is, hateful to God.

*** chapter 36 ***


*** chapter 37 ***

1 "For a remembrance": Viz., of our miseries and sins: and to be sung on the sabbath day.

*** chapter 38 ***


*** chapter 39 ***

13 "My iniquities": That is, the sins of all mankind, which I have taken upon me.
16 "Tis well": The Hebrew here is an interjection of insult and derision, like the Vah. Matt. 27. 49.

*** chapter 40 ***


*** chapter 41 ***


*** chapter 42 ***


*** chapter 43 ***


*** chapter 44 ***

1 "For them that shall be changed": i. e., for souls happily changed, by being converted to God.-- Ibid.
1 "The Beloved": Viz., Our Lord Jesus Christ.

*** chapter 45 ***


*** chapter 46 ***


*** chapter 47 ***


*** chapter 48 ***

6 "The iniquity of my heel": That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned and kicked at my neighbours: or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the iniquity in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of hell shall find me?
7 "They that trust": As much as to say, let them fear that trust in their strength or riches: for they have great reason to fear: seeing no brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.
9 "And shall labour for ever": This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence: as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the end of the world. Others understand it of the eternal sorrows, and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in sin.
11 "He shall not see destruction": Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt from dying.
12 "They have called": That is, they have left their names on their graves, which alone remain of their lands.
14 "They shall delight in their mouth": Notwithstanding the wretched way in which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and glory in their doings.
15 "In the morning": That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the just shall judge and condemn the wicked. Ibid.
15 "From their glory": That is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no more.

*** chapter 49 ***


*** chapter 50 ***


*** chapter 51 ***


*** chapter 52 ***

1 "Maeleth": Or Machalath. A musical instrument, or a chorus of musicians, for St. Jerome renders it, per chorum.
6 "God hath scattered the bones": That is, God has brought to nothing the strength of all those that seek to please men, to the prejudice of their duty to their Maker.

*** chapter 53 ***


*** chapter 54 ***

16 "Let death": This, and such like imprecations which occur in the psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and approving the righteous ways of God: but not by way of ill will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.
19 "Among many": That is, they that drew near to attack me were many in company all combined to fight against me.
22 "They are divided": Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing, by the wrath of God; who looks with indignation on their wicked and deceitful ways.

*** chapter 55 ***

4 "The height of the day": That is, even at noonday, when the sun is the highest, I am still in danger.
5 "My words": The words or promises God has made in my favour.
8 "For nothing shalt thou save them": That is, since they lie in wait to ruin my soul, thou shalt for no consideration favour or assist them, but execute thy justice upon them.

*** chapter 56 ***

1 "Destroy not": Suffer me not to be destroyed.

*** chapter 57 ***

10 "Before your thorns": That is, before your thorns grow up, so as to become strong briers, they shall be overtaken and consumed by divine justice, swallowing them up, as it were, alive in his wrath.
11 "Shall wash his hands": Shall applaud the justice of God, and take occasion from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked to wash and cleanse his hands from sin.

*** chapter 58 ***


*** chapter 59 ***

10 "The pot of my hope": Or my watering pot. That is, a vessel for meaner uses, by being reduced to serve me, even in the meanest employments.-- Ibid.
10 "Foreigners": So the Philistines are called, who had no kindred with the Israelites; whereas the Edomites, Moabites, etc., were originally of the same family.

*** chapter 60 ***


*** chapter 61 ***

10 "Are liars in the balances": They are so vain and light, that if they are put into the scales, they will be found to be of no weight; and to be mere lies, deceit, and vanity. Or, They are liars in their balances, by weighing things by false weights, and preferring the temporal before the eternal.

*** chapter 62 ***


*** chapter 63 ***

7 "A deep heart": That is, crafty, subtle, deep projects and designs; which nevertheless shall not succeed; for God shall be exalted in bringing them to nought by his wisdom and power.
8 "The arrows of children are their wounds": That is, the wounds, stripes, or blows, they seek to inflict upon the just, are but like the weak efforts of children's arrows, which can do no execution: and their tongues, that is, their speeches against them come to nothing.

*** chapter 64 ***

1 "Of the captivity": That is, the people of the captivity of Babylon. This is not in the Hebrew, but is found in the ancient translation of the Septuagint.

*** chapter 65 ***


*** chapter 66 ***


*** chapter 67 ***

5 "Who ascendeth upon the west": Super occasum. St. Gregory understands it of Christ, who after his going down, like the sun, in the west, by his passion and death, ascended more glorious, and carried all before him. St. Jerome renders it, who ascendeth, or cometh up, through the deserts.
7 "Of one manner": That is, agreeing in faith, unanimous in love, and following the same manner of discipline. It is verified in the servants of God, living together in his house, which is the church. 1 Tim. 3. 15.-- Ibid.
7 "Them that were bound": The power and mercy of God appears in his bringing out of their captivity those that were strongly bound in their sins: and in restoring to his grace those whose behaviour had been most provoking; and who by their evil habits were not only dead, but buried in their sepulchres.
10 "A free rain": the manna, which rained plentifully from heaven, in favour of God's inheritance, that is, of his people Israel: which was weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions, but was made perfect by God; that is, was still supported by divine providence, and brought on to the promised land. It agrees particularly to the church of Christ his true inheritance, which is plentifully watered with the free rain of heavenly grace; and through many infirmities, that is, crosses and tribulations, is made perfect, and fitted for eternal glory.
11 "In it": That is, in this church, which is thy fold and thy inheritance, shall thy animals, thy sheep, dwell: where thou hast plentifully provided for them.
12 "To them that preach good tidings": Evangelizantibus. That is, to the preachers of the gospel; who receiving the word from the Lord, shall with great power and efficacy preach throughout the world the glad tidings of a Saviour, and of eternal salvation through him.
13 "The king of powers": That is, the mighty King, the Lord of hosts, is of the beloved, of the beloved; that is, is on the side of Christ, his most beloved son: and his beautiful house, viz., the church, in which God dwells forever, shall by her spiritual conquests divide the spoils of many nations. The Hebrew (as it now stands pointed) is thus rendered, The kings of armies have fled, they have fled, and she that dwells at home (or the beauty of the house) shall divide the spoils.
14 "If you sleep among the midst of lots": (intermedios cleros), Viz., in such dangers and persecutions, as if your enemies were casting lots for your goods and persons: or in the midst of the lots, (intermedios terminos, as St. Jerome renders it,) that is, upon the very bounds or borders of the dominions of your enemies: you shall be secure nevertheless under the divine protection; and shall be enabled to fly away, like a dove, with glittering wings and feathers shining like the palest and most precious gold; that is, with great increase of virtue, and glowing with the fervour of charity.
15 "Kings over her": That is, pastors and rulers over his church, viz., the apostles and their successors. Then by their ministry shall men be made whiter than the snow which lies on the top of the high mountain Selmon.
16 "The mountain of God": The church, which, Isa. 2. 2, is called The mountain of the house of the Lord upon the top of mountains. It is here called a fat and a curdled mountain; that is to say, most fruitful, and enriched by the spiritual gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost.
17 "Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?": Why do you suppose or imagine there may be any other such curdled mountains? You are mistaken: the mountain thus favoured by God is but one; and this same he has chosen for his dwelling for ever.
18 "The chariot of God": Descending to give his law on mount Sina: as also of Jesus Christ his Son, ascending into heaven, to send from thence the Holy Ghost, to publish his new law, is attended with ten thousands, that is, with an innumerable multitude of joyful angels.
19 "Led captivity captive": Carrying away with thee to heaven those who before had been the captives of Satan; and receiving from God the Father gifts to be distributed to men; even to those who were before unbelievers.
21 "The issues from death": The Lord alone is master of the issues, by which we may escape from death.
23 "I will turn them from Basan": I will cast out my enemies from their rich possessions, signified by Basan, a fruitful country; and I will drive them into the depth of the sea: and make such a slaughter of them, that the feet of my servants may be dyed in their blood, etc.
25 "Thy goings": Thy ways, thy proceedings, by which thou didst formerly take possession of the promised land in favour of thy people; and shalt afterwards of the whole world, which thou shalt subdue to thy Son.
26 "Princes": The apostles, the first converters of nations; attended by numbers of perfect souls, singing the divine praises, and virgins consecrated to God.
27 "From the fountains of Israel": From whom both Christ and his apostles sprung. By Benjamin, the holy fathers on this place understand St. Paul, who was of that tribe, named here a youth, because he was the last called to the apostleship. By the princes of Juda, Zabulon, and Nephthali, we may understand the other apostles, who were of the tribe of Juda; or of the tribes of Zabulon, and Nephthali, where our Lord began to preach, Matt. 4. 13, etc.
29 "Command thy strength": Give orders that thy strength may be always with us.
31 "Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds": or the wild beasts, which lie hid in the reeds. That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to surprise their prey. Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors, who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds, which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of the Almighty. The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine, that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried by fire.
32 "Ambassadors shall come": It is a prophecy of the conversion of the Gentiles, and by name of the Egyptians and Ethiopians.
34 "To the east": From mount Olivet, which is on the east side of Jerusalem.-- Ibid.
34 "The voice of power": That is, he will make his voice to be a powerful voice: by calling from death to life, such as were dead in mortal sin: as at the last day he will by the power of his voice call all the dead from their graves.

*** chapter 68 ***

1 "For them that shall be changed": A psalm for Christian converts, to remember the passion of Christ.
2 "The waters": Of afflictions and sorrows. My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Matt. 26. 38.
5 "I pay that which I took not away": Christ in his passion made restitution of what he had not taken away, by suffering the punishment due to our sins, and so repairing the injury we had done to God.
6 "My foolishness and my offences": which my enemies impute to me: or the follies and sins of men, which I have taken upon myself.
23 "Let their table": What here follows in the style of an imprecation, is a prophecy of the wretched state to which the Jews should be reduced in punishment of their wilful obstinacy.
36 "Sion": The catholic church. The cities of Juda, etc., her places of worship, which shall be established throughout the world. And there, viz., in this church of Christ, shall his servants dwell, etc.

*** chapter 69 ***

4 "Tis well, tis well": Euge, euge. St. Jerome renders it, vah, vah! which is the voice of one insulting and deriding. Some understand it as a detestation of deceitful flatterers.

*** chapter 70 ***

1 "Of the sons of Jonadab": The Rechabites, of whom see Jer. 35. By this addition of the seventy-two interpreters, we gather that this psalm was usually sung in the synagogue, in the person of the Rechabites, and of those who were first carried away into captivity.
15 "Learning": As much as to say, I build not upon human learning, but only on the power and justice of God.

*** chapter 71 ***

16 "A firmament on the earth": This may be understood of the church of Christ, ever firm and visible: and of the flourishing condition of its congregation.
20 "Are ended": By this it appears that this psalm, though placed here, was in order of time the last of those which David composed.

*** chapter 72 ***

7 "Fatness": Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them in their iniquity: and made them give themselves up to their irregular affections.
10 "Return here": or hither. The weak among the servants of God, will be apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence which are set down in the following verses.
15 "If I said": That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.
18 "Thou hast put it to them": In punishment of their deceits, or for deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end, which, in their prosperity they never apprehended.

*** chapter 73 ***

4 "Their ensigns": They have fixed their colours for signs and trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the temple: and they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place. This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the profanation of the temple by Antiochus.
13 "The sea firm": By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm walls, whilst Israel passed through: and destroying the Egyptians called here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their king: casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.
15 "Ethan rivers": That is, rivers which run with strong streams. This was verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21. 14.
20 "The obscure of the earth": Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled, that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired.

*** chapter 74 ***

1 "Corrupt not": It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or hymn, to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung. St. Augustine and other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God, not to faint or fail in our hope: but to persevere with constancy in good: because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man according to his works.
3 "When I shall take a time": In proper times: particularly at the last day, when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great Judge: the same who originally laid the foundations of it, and as it were established its pillars.

*** chapter 75 ***

8 "From that time": From the time that thy wrath shall break out.

*** chapter 76 ***


*** chapter 77 ***

2 "Propositions": Deep and mysterious sayings. By this it appears that the historical facts of ancient times, commemorated in this psalm, were deep and mysterious: as being figures of great truths appertaining to the time of the New Testament.
69 "As of unicorns": That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn. This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm, foreshewing the firm establishment of the one, true, and everlasting sanctuary of God, in his church.

*** chapter 78 ***


*** chapter 79 ***

17 "Things set on fire": So this vineyard of thine, almost consumed already, must perish, if thou continue thy rebukes.
18 "The man of thy right hand": Christ.

*** chapter 80 ***

1 "For the winepresses": Torcularibus. It either signifies a musical instrument, or that this psalm was to be sung at the feast of the tabernacles after the gathering in of the vintage.
8 "In the secret place of tempest": Heb., Of thunder. When thou soughtest to hide thyself from the tempest: or, when I came down to mount Sina, hidden from thy eyes in a storm of thunder.
16 "Their time shall be for ever": Impenitent sinners shall suffer for ever.

*** chapter 81 ***


*** chapter 82 ***


*** chapter 83 ***

6 "In his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps": Ascensiones in corde suo disposuit. As by steps men ascended to the temple of God situated on a hill; so the good Christian ascends towards the eternal temple by certain steps of virtue disposed or ordered within the heart: and this whilst he lives as yet in the body, in this vale of tears, the place which man hath set: that is, which he hath brought himself to: being cast out of paradise for his sin.

*** chapter 84 ***


*** chapter 85 ***

2 "I am holy": I am by my office and profession dedicated to thy service.

*** chapter 86 ***

1 "The holy mountains": The apostles and prophets. Eph. 2. 20.
4 "Rahab": Egypt, etc. To this Sion, which is the church of God, many shall resort from all nations.
5 "Shall not Sion say": The meaning is, that Sion, viz., the church, shall not only be able to commemorate this or that particular person of renown born in her, but also to glory in great multitudes of people and princes of her communion; who have been foretold in the writings of the prophets, and registered in the writings of the apostles.

*** chapter 87 ***

1 "Maheleth": A musical instrument, or chorus of musicians, to answer one another.-- Ibid.
1 "Understanding": Or a psalm of instruction, composed by Eman the Ezrahite, or by David, in his name.

*** chapter 88 ***

40 "Overthrown the covenant": All this seems to relate to the time of the captivity of Babylon, in which, for the sins of the people and their princes, God seemed to have set aside for a while the covenant he made with David.

*** chapter 89 ***

3 "Turn not man away": Suffer him not quite to perish from thee, since thou art pleased to call upon him to be converted to thee.
9 "As a spider": As frail and weak as a spider's web; and miserable withal, whilst like a spider we spend our bowels in weaving webs to catch flies.
10 "Mildness is come upon us": God's mildness corrects us; inasmuch as he deals kindly with us, in shortening the days of this miserable life; and so weaning our affections from all its transitory enjoyments, and teaching us true wisdom.

*** chapter 90 ***


*** chapter 91 ***


*** chapter 92 ***


*** chapter 93 ***

13 "Rest from the evil days": That thou mayst mitigate the sorrows, to which he is exposed, during the short and evil days of his mortality.
15 "Until justice be turned into judgment": By being put in execution; which will be agreeable to all the upright in heart.
20 "Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee": That is, wilt thou, O God, who art always just, admit of the seat of iniquity: that is, of injustice, or unjust judges, to have any partnership with thee? Thou who framest, or makest, labour in commandment, that is, thou who obligest us to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments.

*** chapter 94 ***


*** chapter 95 ***

1 "When the house was built": Alluding to that time, and then ordered to be sung: but principally relating to the building of the church of Christ, after our redemption from the captivity of Satan.

*** chapter 96 ***

2 "Clouds and darkness": The coming of Christ in the clouds with great terror and majesty to judge the world, is here prophesied.

*** chapter 97 ***


*** chapter 98 ***

1 "Let the people be angry": Though many enemies rage, and the whole earth be stirred up to oppose the reign of Christ, he shall still prevail.
4 "Loveth judgment": Requireth discretion.-- Ibid.
4 "Directions": Most right and just laws to direct men.
5 "Adore his footstool": The ark of the covenant was called, in the Old Testament, God's footstool: over which he was understood to sit, on his propitiatory, or mercy seat, as on a throne, between the wings of the cherubims, in the sanctuary: to which the children of Israel paid a great veneration. But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries: inasmuch as the humanity of Christ is, as it were, the footstool of the divinity. So St. Ambrose, L. 3. De Spiritu Sancto, c. 12. And St. Augustine upon this psalm.
6 "Moses and Aaron among his priests": By this it is evident, that Moses also was a priest, and indeed the chief priest, inasmuch as he consecrated Aaron, and offered sacrifice for him. Lev. 8. So that his pre-eminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship.
8 "All their inventions": that is, all the enterprises of their enemies against them, as in the case of Core, Dathan, and Abiron.

*** chapter 99 ***


*** chapter 100 ***

2 "I will understand": That is, I will apply my mind, I will do my endeavour, to know and to follow the perfect way of thy commandments: not trusting to my own strength, but relying on thy coming to me by thy grace.

*** chapter 101 ***

7 "A pelican": I am become through grief, like birds that affect solitude and darkness.
24 "He answered him in the way of his strength": That is, the people, mentioned in the foregoing verse, or the penitent, in whose person this psalm is delivered, answered the Lord in the way of his strength: that is, according to the best of his power and strength: or when he was in the flower of his age and strength: inquiring after the fewness of his days: to know if he should live long enough to see the happy restoration of Sion, etc.

*** chapter 102 ***


*** chapter 103 ***


*** chapter 104 ***

25 "He turned their heart": Not that God (who is never the author of sin) moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people; but that the Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them, from the sight of the benefits which God bestowed upon them.
28 "Grieved not his words": That is, he was not wanting to fulfil his words: or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron, the carriers of his words: or he did not grieve his words, that is, his sons, the children of Israel, who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with darkness.
31 "Sciniphs": See the annotation, Ex. 8. 16.
34 "Bruchus": An insect of the locust kind.
45 "His justifications": That is, his commandments; which here, and in many other places of the scripture, are called justifications, because the keeping of them makes man just. The Protestants render it by the word statutes, in favour of their doctrine, which does not allow good works to justify.

*** chapter 105 ***

28 "Initiated": That is, they dedicated, or consecrated themselves to the idol of the Moabites and Madianites, called Beelphegor, or Baal-Peor. Num. 25. 3.-- Ibid.
28 "The dead": Viz., idols without life.
33 "He distinguished with his lips": Moses, by occasion of the people's rebellion and incredulity, was guilty of distinguishing with his lips; when, instead of speaking to the rock, as God had commanded, he said to the people, with a certain hesitation in his faith, Hear ye, rebellious and incredulous: Can we from this rock bring out water for you? Num. 20. 10.

*** chapter 106 ***


*** chapter 107 ***


*** chapter 108 ***

6 "Set thou the sinner over him": Give to the devil, that arch-sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as curses.
24 "For oil": Propter oleum. The meaning is, my flesh is changed, being perfectly emaciated and dried up, as having lost all its oil or fatness.

*** chapter 118 ***

2 "His testimonies": The commandments of God are called his testimonies, because they testify his holy will unto us. Note here, that in almost every verse of this psalm (which in number are 176) the word and law of God, and the love and observance of it, is perpetually inculcated, under a variety of denominations, all signifying the same thing.
