*** the book of Second Book Of Kings _2 Samuel_ ***

*** chapter 1 ***

10 "I killed him": This story of the young Amalecite was not true, as may easily be proved by comparing it with the last chapter of the foregoing book.

*** chapter 2 ***

10 "He reigned two years": Viz., before he began visibly to decline: but in all he reigned seven years and six months; for so long David reigned in Hebron.

*** chapter 3 ***

1 "There was a long war between the house of Saul": Rather a strife or emulation than a war with arms; it lasted five years and a half.

*** chapter 4 ***


*** chapter 5 ***

12 "Choirs": Or companies of musicians.

16 "Recorder": Or chancellor.
17 "Scribe": Or secretary.

*** chapter 9 ***


*** chapter 10 ***


*** chapter 11 ***


*** chapter 12 ***

11 "I will raise": All these evils, inasmuch as they were punishments, came upon David by a just judgment of God, for his sin, and therefore God says, I will raise, etc.; but inasmuch as they were sins, on the part of Absalom and his associates, God was not the author of them, but only permitted them.
25 "Amiable to the Lord": Or, beloved of the Lord. In Hebrew, Jedidiah.
27 "The city of waters": Rabbath the royal city of the Ammonites, was called the city of waters, from being encompassed with waters.

*** chapter 13 ***

3 "A very wise man": That is, a crafty and subtle man: for the counsel he gave on this occasion shews that his wisdom was but carnal and worldly.

*** chapter 14 ***

22 "Blessed": That is, and gave thanks to the king.

*** chapter 15 ***

16 "Concubines": That is, wives of an inferior degree.
30 "Weeping": David on this occasion wept for his sins, which he knew were the cause of all his sufferings.

*** chapter 16 ***

10 "Hath bid him curse": Not that the Lord was the author of Semei's sin, which proceeded purely from his own malice, and the abuse of his free will. But that knowing, and suffering his malicious disposition to break out on this occasion, he made use of him as his instrument to punish David for his sins.
21 "Their hands may be strengthened": The people might apprehend lest Absalom should be reconciled to his father, and therefore they followed him with some fear of being left in the lurch, till they saw such a crime committed as seemed to make a reconciliation impossible.

*** chapter 17 ***

24 "To the camp": The city of Mahanaim, the name of which, in Hebrew, signifies The camp. It was a city of note at that time, as appears from its having been chosen by Isboseth for the place of his residence.

*** chapter 18 ***

8 "Consumed": Viz., by pits and precipices.
18 "No son": The sons mentioned above, chap. 14. 27, were dead when this pillar was erected: unless we suppose he raised this pillar before they were born.
33 "Would to God": David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died: and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In which he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him.

*** chapter 19 ***


*** chapter 20 ***

14 "Abela and Bethmaacha": Cities of the tribe of Nephtali.

*** chapter 21 ***

8 "Of Michol": They were the sons of Merob, who was married to Hadriel: but they are here called the sons of Michol, because she adopted them, and brought them up as her own.
19 "Adeodatus the son of the Forrest": So it is rendered in the Latin Vulgate, by giving the interpretation of the Hebrew names, which are Elhanan the son of Jaare.

*** chapter 22 ***


*** chapter 23 ***

4 "As the light": So shall be the kingdom of Christ.
5 "Neither is my house": As if he should say: This everlasting covenant was not due to my house: but purely owing to his bounty; who is all my salvation, and my will: that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I beseeched of him; so that I and my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things.
8 "Jesbaham": The son of Hachamoni. For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chron. or Paralip. 11.-- Ibid.
8 "Most tender": He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong. It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom Jesbaham was like, instead of the name itself, which was Adino the Eznite, one much renowned of old for his valour.
9 "Dodo": In Latin, Patrui ejus, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name Dodo. The same occurs in ver. 24.

*** chapter 24 ***

1 "Stirred up": This stirring up was not the doing of God, but of Satan; as it is expressly declared, 1 Chron. or Paralip. 21. 1.
10 "David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered": That is he was touched with a great remorse for the vanity and pride which had put him upon numbering the people.
