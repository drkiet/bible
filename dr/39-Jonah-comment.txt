*** the book of Prophecy Of Jonas _Jonah_ ***

*** chapter 1 ***

2 "Ninive": The capital city of the Assyrian empire.
3 "Tharsis": Which some take to be Tharsus of Cilicia, others to be Tartessus of Spain, others to be Carthage.
5 "A deep sleep": This is a lively image of the insensibility of sinners, fleeing from God, and threatened on every side with his judgments: and yet sleeping as if they were secure.

*** chapter 2 ***

11 "Spoke to the fish": God's speaking to the fish, was nothing else but his will, which all things obey.

*** chapter 3 ***

3 "Of three days' journey": By the computation of some ancient historians, Ninive was about fifty miles round: so that to go through all the chief streets and public places was three days' journey.

*** chapter 4 ***

1 "Was exceedingly troubled": His concern was lest he should pass for a false prophet; or rather, lest God's word, by this occasion, might come to be slighted and disbelieved.
6 "The Lord God prepared an ivy": Hederam. In the Hebrew it is Kikajon, which some render a gourd: others a palmerist, or palma Christi.
