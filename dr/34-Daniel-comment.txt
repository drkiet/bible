*** the book of Prophecy Of Daniel ***

*** chapter 1 ***

2 "His god": Bel or Belus, the principal idol of the Chaldeans.
8 "Be defiled": Viz., either by eating meat forbidden by the law, or which had before been offered to idols.
12 "Pulse": That is, pease, beans, and such like.

*** chapter 2 ***

1 "The second year": Viz., from the death of his father Nabopolassar; for he had reigned before as partner with his father in the empire.
2 "The Chaldeans": That is, the astrologers, that pretended to divine by stars.
39 "Another kingdom": Viz., that of the Medes and Persians. Ibid.
39 "Third kingdom": Viz., that of Alexander the Great.
40 "The fourth kingdom": Some understand this of the successors of Alexander, the kings of Syria and Egypt, others of the Roman empire, and its civil wars.
44 "A kingdom": Viz., the kingdom of Christ in the Catholic Church which cannot be destroyed.

*** chapter 3 ***

24 "And they walked": Here St. Jerome takes notice, that from this verse, to ver. 91, was not in the Hebrew in his time. But as it was in all the Greek Bibles, (which were originally translated from the Hebrew,) it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the Hebrew or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the book of Daniel was written. But this is certain: that it is, and has been of old, received by the church, and read as canonical scripture in her liturgy, and divine offices.
98 "Nabuchodonosor": These last three verses are a kind of preface to the following chapter, which is written in the style of an epistle from the king.

*** chapter 4 ***

5 "Baltassar, according to the name of my god": He says this, because the name of Baltassar, or Belteshazzar, is derived from the name of Bel, the chief god of the Babylonians.
10 "A watcher": A vigilant angel, perhaps the guardian of Israel.
13 "Let his heart be changed": It does not appear by scripture that Nabuchodonosor was changed from human shape; much less that he was changed into an ox; but only that he lost his reason, and became mad; and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts, eating grass like an ox, till his hair grew in such manner as to resemble the feathers of eagles, and his nails to be like birds' claws.
34 "I Nabuchodonosor do now": From this place some commentators infer that this king became a true convert, and dying not long after, was probably saved.

*** chapter 5 ***

1 "Baltasar": He is believed to be the same as Nabonydus, the last of the Chaldean kings, grandson to Nabuchodonosor. He is called his son, ver. 2, 11, etc., according to the style of the scriptures, because he was a descendant from him.
10 "The queen": Not the wife, but the mother of the king.
31 "Darius": He is called Cyaxares by the historians; and was the son of Astyages, and uncle to Cyrus.

*** chapter 6 ***


*** chapter 7 ***

3 "Four great beasts": Viz., the Chaldean, Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires. But some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the successors of Alexander the Great, more especially of them that reigned in Asia and Syria.
7 "Ten horns": That is, ten kingdoms, (as Apoc. 17. 12,) among which the empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled. Or ten kings of the number of the successors of Alexander; as figures of such as shall be about the time of Antichrist.
8 "Another little horn": This is commonly understood of Antichrist. It may also be applied to that great persecutor Antiochus Epiphanes, as a figure of Antichrist.
25 "A time, and times, and half a time": That is, three years and a half; which is supposed to be the length of the duration of the persecution of Antichrist.

*** chapter 8 ***

3 "A ram": The empire of the Medes and Persians.
5 "A he goat": The empire of the Greeks, or Macedonians. Ibid.
5 "He touched not the ground": He conquered all before him, with so much rapidity, that he seemed rather to fly, than to walk upon the earth.-- Ibid.
5 "A notable horn": Alexander the Great.
8 "Four horns": Seleucus, Antigonus, Philip, and Ptolemeus, the successors of Alexander, who divided his empire among them.
9 "A little horn": Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of Seleucus. He grew against the south, and the east, by his victories over the kings of Egypt and Armenia: and against the strength, that is, against Jerusalem and the people of God.
10 "Unto the strength of heaven": or, against the strength of heaven. So are here called the army of the Jews, the people of God.
14 "Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days": That is, six years and almost four months: which was the whole time from the beginning of the persecution of Antiochus till his death.

*** chapter 9 ***

21 "The man Gabriel": The angel Gabriel in the shape of a man.
23 "Man of desires": that is, ardently praying for the Jews then in captivity.
24 "Seventy weeks": Viz., of years, (or seventy times seven, that is, 490 years,) are shortened; that is, fixed and determined, so that the time shall be no longer.
25 "From the going forth of the word": That is, from the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, when by his commandment Nehemias rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, 2 Esd. 2. From which time, according to the best chronology, there were just sixty-nine weeks of years, that is, 483 years to the baptism of Christ, when he first began to preach and execute the office of Messias.-- Ibid.
25 "In straitness of times": angustia temporum: which may allude both to the difficulties and opposition they met with in building: and to the shortness of the time in which they finished the wall, viz., fifty-two days.
26 "A people with their leader": The Romans under Titus.
27 "In the half of the week": or, in the middle of the week, etc. Because Christ preached three years and a half: and then by his sacrifice upon the cross abolished all the sacrifices of the law.-- Ibid.
27 "The abomination of desolation": Some understand this of the profanation of the temple by the crimes of the Jews, and by the bloody faction of the zealots. Others of the bringing in thither the ensigns and standard of the pagan Romans. Others, in fine, distinguish three different times of desolation: viz., that under Antiochus; that when the temple was destroyed by the Romans; and the last near the end of the world under Antichrist. To all which, as they suppose, this prophecy may have a relation.

*** chapter 10 ***

13 "The prince": That is, the angel guardian of Persia: who according to his office, seeking the spiritual good of the Persians was desirous that many of the Jews should remain among them.
21 "Michael your prince": The guardian general of the church of God.

*** chapter 11 ***

2 "Three kings": Viz., Cambyses, Smerdes Magus, and Darius, the son of Hystaspes.-- Ibid.
2 "The fourth": Xerxes.
3 "A strong king": Alexander.
5 "The king of the south": Ptolemeus the son of Lagus, king of Egypt, which lies south of Jerusalem.-- Ibid.
5 "One of his princes": that is, one of Alexander's princes, shall prevail over him: that is, shall be stronger than the king of Egypt. He speaks of Seleucus Nicator, king of Asia and Syria, whose successors are here called the kings of the north, because their dominions lay to the north in respect to Jerusalem.
6 "The daughter of the king of the south": Viz., Berenice, daughter of Ptolemeus Philadelphus, given in marriage to Antiochus Theos, grandson of Seleucus.
7 "A plant": Ptolemeus Evergetes, the son of Philadelphus.
8 "The king of the north": Seleucus Callinicus.
10 "His sons": Seleucus Ceraunius, and Antiochus the Great, the sons of Callinicus.-- Ibid.
10 "He shall come": Viz., Antiochus the Great.
11 "The king of the south": Ptolemeus Philopator, son of Evergetes.
16 "He shall come upon him": Viz., Antiochus shall come upon the king of the south.-- Ibid.
16 "The glorious land": Judea.
17 "All his kingdom": Viz., all the kingdom of Ptolemeus Epiphanes, son of Philopator.-- Ibid.
17 "A daughter of women": That is, a most beautiful woman, viz., his daughter Cleopatra.-- Ibid.
17 "To overthrow it": Viz., the kingdom of Epiphanes: but his policy shall not succeed; for Cleopatra shall take more to heart the interest of her husband, than that of her father.
18 "The prince of his reproach": Seipio the Roman general, called the prince of his reproach, because he overthrew Antiochus, and obliged him to submit to very dishonourable terms, before he would cease from the war.
20 "One most vile": Seleucus Philopator, who sent Heliodorus to plunder the temple: and was shortly after slain by the same Heliodorus.
21 "One despised": Viz., Antiochus Epiphanes, who at first was despised and not received for king. What is here said of this prince, is accommodated by St. Jerome and others to Antichrist; of whom this Antiochus was a figure.
22 "Of the fighter": That is, of them that shall oppose him, and shall fight against him.-- Ibid.
22 "The prince of the covenant": or, of the league. The chief of them that conspired against him: or the king of Egypt his most powerful adversary.
25 "The king": Ptolemeus Philometor.
30 "The galleys and the Romans": Popilius, and the other Roman ambassadors, who came in galleys, and obliged him to depart from Egypt.
31 "They shall place there the abomination": The idol of Jupiter Olympius, which Antiochus ordered to be set up in the sanctuary of the temple: which is here called the sanctuary of strength, from the Almighty that was worshipped there.
38 "The god Maozim": That is, the god of forces or strong holds.
39 "And he shall increase glory": He shall bestow honours, riches and lands, upon them that shall worship his god.
45 "Apadno": Some take it for the proper name of a place: others, from the Hebrew, translate it his palace.

*** chapter 12 ***

3 "Learned": Viz., in the law of God and true wisdom, which consists in knowing and loving God.

*** chapter 13 ***


*** chapter 14 ***

1 "The king's guest": It seems most probable, that the king here spoken of was Evilmerodach, the son and successor of Nabuchodonosor, and a great favourer of the Jews.
30 "The den of lions": Daniel was twice cast into the den of lions; one under Darius the Mede, because he had transgressed the king's edict, by praying three times a day: and another time under Evilmerodach by a sedition of the people. This time he remained six days in the lions' den; the other time only one night.
32 "Habacuc": The same, as some think whose prophecy is found among the lesser prophets but others believe him to be different.
