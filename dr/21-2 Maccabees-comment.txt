*** the book of Second Book Of Machabees ***

*** chapter 1 ***

9 "Scenopegia": Viz., the Encenia, or feast of the dedication of the altar, called here Scenopegia, or feast of tabernacles, from being celebrated with the like solemnity.
11 "Such a king": Viz., Antiochus Sidetes, who began to make war upon the Jews, whilst Simon was yet alive. 1 Mac. 15. 39. And afterwards besieged Jerusalem under John Hircanus. So that the Judas here mentioned, ver. 10, is not Judas Machabeus, who was dead long before the year 188 of the kingdom of the Greeks, for he died in the year 146 of that epoch, (see above 1 Mac. chap. 2., ver. 70, also the note on chap. 1, ver. 2,) but either Judas the eldest son of John Hircanus, or Judas the Essene, renowned for the gift of prophecy, who flourished about that time.
13 "Nanea": A Persian goddess, which some have taken for Diana, others for Venus.
19 "Persia": Babylonia, called here Persia, from being afterwards a part of the Persian empire.
34 "A temple": That is, an enclosure, or a wall round about the place where the fire was hid, to separate it from profane uses, to the end that it might be respected as a holy place.

*** chapter 2 ***

1 "The descriptions": That is, the records or memoirs of Jeremias, a work that is now lost.
16 "The purification": That is, the feast of the purifying or cleansing of the temple.
27 "No easy task": The spirit of God, that assists the sacred penmen, does not exempt them from labour in seeking out the matter which they are to treat of, and the order and manner in which they are to deliver it. So St. Luke writ the gospel having diligently attained to all things. Luke 1. ver. 3.

*** chapter 3 ***

3 "Seleucus": Son of Antiochus the Great, and elder brother of Antiochus Epiphanes.

*** chapter 4 ***

45 "Ptolemee": The son of Dorymenus, a favourite of the king.

*** chapter 5 ***

27 "Was the tenth": That is, he had nine others in his company.

*** chapter 6 ***

2 "That in Gazarim": Viz., the temple of the Samaritans. And as they were originally strangers, the name of Hospitalis (which signifies of or belonging to strangers) was applicable to the idol set up in their temple.
11 "Philip": The governor of Jerusalem.
21 "Wicked pity": Their pity was wicked, inasmuch as it suggested that wicked proposal of saving his life by dissimulation.

*** chapter 7 ***


*** chapter 8 ***

8 "Philip seeing": The governor of Jerusalem found himself unable to contend with Judas, especially after the victories he had obtained over Apollonius and Seron. 1 Mac. 3.
9 "Twenty thousand": The whole number of the forces sent at that time into Judea, was 40, 000 footmen, and 7000 horsemen, 1 Mac. 3. 30. But only 20, 000 are here taken notice of, because there were no more with Nicanor at the time of the battle.
16 "Seven thousand": In the Greek it is six thousand. But then three thousand of them had no arms. 1 Mac. 4. 6.
20 "Galatians": That is, the Gauls, who having ravaged Italy and Greece, poured themselves in upon Asia, in immense multitudes, where also they founded the kingdom of Galatia or Gallo Graecia.
24 "Above nine thousand": Viz., including the three thousand slain in the pursuit.
35 "Laying aside his garment of glory": That is, his splendid apparel, which he wore through ostentation; he now throws it off, lest he should be known on his flight.

*** chapter 9 ***

2 "Persepolis": Otherwise called Elymais.
13 "Of whom he was not like to obtain mercy": Because his repentance was not for the offence committed against God: but barely on account of his present sufferings.

*** chapter 10 ***

15 "The Jews": He speaks of them that had fallen from their religion, and were enemies of their country, who joining with the Idumeans or Edomites, kept possession of the strong holds, and from thence annoyed their countrymen.
37 "Timotheus": This man, who was killed at the taking of Gazara, is different from that Timotheus who is mentioned in the fifth chapter of the first book of Machabees, and of whom there is mention in the following chapter.

*** chapter 11 ***

21 "In the year 148": Viz., according to the computation followed by the Greeks; which was different from that of the Hebrews, followed by the writer of the first book of Machabees. However, by this date, as well as by other circumstances, it appears that the expedition of Lysias, mentioned in this chapter, is different from that which is recorded, 1 Mac. 6.

*** chapter 12 ***

15 "Rams": That is, engines for battering walls, etc., which were used in sieges in those times.
29 "Scythopolis": Formerly called Bethsan.
40 "Of the donaries": That is, of the votive offerings, which had been hung up in the temples of the idols, which they had taken away when they burnt the port of Jamnia, ver. 9., contrary to the prohibition of the law, Deut. 7. 25.
45 "With godliness": Judas hoped that these men who died fighting for the cause of God and religion, might find mercy: either because they might be excused from mortal sin by ignorance; or might have repented of their sin, at least at their death.
46 "It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead": Here is an evident and undeniable proof of the practice of praying for the dead under the old law, which was then strictly observed by the Jews, and consequently could not be introduced at that time by Judas, their chief and high priest, if it had not been always their custom.

*** chapter 13 ***

2 "A hundred and ten thousand": The difference between the numbers here set down, and those recorded, 1 Mac. 4, is easily accounted for; if we consider that such armies as these are liable to be at one time more numerous than at another; either by sending away large detachments, or being diminished by sickness; or increased by receiving fresh supplies of troops, according to different exigencies or occurrences.

*** chapter 14 ***

3 "Alcimus, who had been chief priest": This Alcimus was of the stock of Aaron, but for his apostasy here mentioned was incapable of the high priesthood, but king Antiochus Eupator appointed him in place of the high priest, (see above, 1 Mac. chap. 7., ver. 9,) as Menelaus had been before him, set up by Antiochus (above chap. 4.), yet neither of them were truly high priests; for the true high priesthood was amongst the Machabees, who were also of the stock of Aaron, and had strictly held their religion, and were ordained according to the rites commanded in the law of Moses.-- Ibid.
3 "Mingling": with the heathens; that is, in their idolatrous worship.
41 "He struck himself": St. Augustine, (Epist. 61, ad Dulcitium, et lib. 2, cap. 23, ad Epist. 2, Gaud.) discussing this fact of Razias, says, that the holy scripture relates it, but doth not praise it, as to be admired or imitated, and that either it was not well done by him, or at least not proper in this time of grace.
44 "He came upon the midst of the neck": Venit per mediam cervicem. In the Greek it is keneona, which signifies a void place, where there is no building.

*** chapter 15 ***

39 "If not so perfectly": This is not said with regard to the truth of the narration; but with regard to the style and manner of writing: which in the sacred penmen is not always the most accurate. See St. Paul, 2 Cor. 11. 6.
