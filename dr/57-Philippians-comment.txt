*** the book of Epistle Of Saint Paul To The Philippians ***

*** chapter 1 ***

22 "This is to me": His meaning is, that although his dying immediately for Christ would be his gain, by putting him presently in possession of heaven; yet he is doubtful what he should choose, because by staying longer in the flesh, he should be more beneficial to the souls of his neighbours.

*** chapter 2 ***

7 "Emptied himself": exinanivit, made himself as of no account.
12 "With fear": This is against the false faith, and presumptuous security of modern sectaries.

*** chapter 3 ***


*** chapter 4 ***

8 "Whatsoever things are true": Here the apostle enumerates general precepts of morality, which they ought to practise, in words, in promises, in lawful oaths, etc., he commands rectitude of mind, and sincerity of heart.
8 "Whatsoever modest": by these words he prescribes gravity in manners, modesty in dress, and decency in conversation. Whatsoever just-- That is, in dealing with others, in buying or selling, in trade or business, to be fair and honest.
8 "Whatsoever holy": by these words may be understood, that those who are in a religious state professed, or in holy orders, should lead a life of sanctity and chastity, according to the vows they make; but these words being also applied to those in the world, indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the divine commandments to follow.
8 "Whatsoever lovely": that is, to practise those good offices in society, that procure us the esteem and good will of our neighbours. Whatsoever of good fame-- That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them good example by our actions. If there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline-- that those in error, by seeing the morality and good discipline of the true religion, may be converted. And finally, the apostle commands, not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things-- that is, to make it their study and concern that the peace of God might be with them.
