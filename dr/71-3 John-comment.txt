*** the book of Third Epistle Of Saint John ***

*** chapter 1 ***

4 "No greater grace": that is nothing that gives me greater joy and satisfaction.
7 "Taking nothing of the Gentiles": These ministers of the gospel are commended by St. John, who took nothing from the Gentiles, lest they should seem to preach in order to get money by it.
9 "Diotrephes, who loveth": This man seemeth to be in power, but not a friend to the faithful; therefore this part of the letter might be an admonition to him from the apostle.
