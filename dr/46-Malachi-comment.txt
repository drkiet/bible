*** the book of Prophecy Of Malachias _Malachi_ ***

*** chapter 1 ***

2 "I have loved Jacob": I have preferred his posterity, to make them my chosen people, and to lead them with my blessings, without any merit on their part, and though they have been always ungrateful; whilst I have rejected Esau, and executed severe judgments upon his posterity. Not that God punished Esau, or his posterity, beyond their desert: but that by his free election and grace he loved Jacob, and favoured his posterity above their deserts. See the annotations upon Rom. 9.
11 "A clean oblation": Viz., the precious body and blood of Christ in the eucharistic sacrifice.
13 "Behold of our labour": You pretended labour and weariness, when you brought your offering; and so made it of no value, by offering it with an evil mind. Moreover, what you offered was both defective in itself, and gotten by rapine and extortion.

*** chapter 2 ***

3 "I will cast the shoulder to you": I will cast away the shoulder, which in the law was appointed to be your portion, and fling it at you in my anger: and will reject both you and your festivals like dung.
7 "The angel": Viz., the minister and messenger.
13 "With tears": Viz., by occasion of your wives, whom you have put away: and who came to weep and lament before the altar.
16 "Iniquity shall cover his garment": Viz., of every man that putteth away his wife without just cause; notwithstanding that God permitted it in the law, to prevent the evil of murder.

*** chapter 3 ***

1 "My angel": Viz., John the Baptist, the messenger of God, and forerunner of Christ.

*** chapter 4 ***

6 "He shall turn the heart": By bringing over the Jews to the faith of Christ, he shall reconcile them to their fathers, viz., the partiarchs and prophets; whose hearts for many ages have been turned away from them, because of their refusing to believe in Christ.-- Ibid.
6 "With anathema": In the Hebrew, Cherem, that is, with utter destruction.
