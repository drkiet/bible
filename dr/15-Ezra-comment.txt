21 "I proclaimed there a fast": It is not enough to part from Babylon, that is, figuratively from sin, but we must also do works of penance; and therefore Esdras here proclaimed an extraordinary fast to those that were come from captivity. This shews that fasting was commanded and practised from the earliest times.

1 "Have not separated themselves": This shews how sinful it is to intermarry with those that the Church forbids us, on account of the danger of perversion and falling off from the true faith.
8 "A pin": or nail, here signifies a small settlement or holding; which Esdras begs for, to preserve even a part of the people, who, by their great iniquity had incurred the anger of God.
