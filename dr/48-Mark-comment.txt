*** chapter 1 ***


*** chapter 2 ***


*** chapter 3 ***


*** chapter 4 ***

12 "That seeing they may see": in punishment of their wilfully shutting their eyes, (St. Matt. 13. 15,) God justly withdrew those lights and graces, which otherwise he would have given them, for their effectual conversion.

*** chapter 5 ***


*** chapter 6 ***

5 "He could not": Not for want of power, but because he would not work miracles in favour of obstinate and incredulous people, who were unworthy of such favours.
20 "And kept him": That is, from the designs of Herodias; and for fear of the people, would not put him to death, though she sought it; and through her daughter she effected her wish.

*** chapter 7 ***

7 "Doctrines and precepts of men": See the annotations, Matt. 15. 9, 11.

*** chapter 8 ***


*** chapter 9 ***


*** chapter 10 ***

18 "None is good": Of himself entirely and essentially, but God alone; men may be good also, but only by participation of God's goodness.

*** chapter 11 ***


*** chapter 12 ***


*** chapter 13 ***

32 "Nor the Son": Not that the Son of God is absolutely ignorant of the day of judgment, but that he knoweth it not, as our teacher; that is, he knoweth it not so as to teach it to us, as not being expedient.

*** chapter 14 ***

1 "Azymes": That is, the feast of the unleavened bread.
30 "Crow twice": The cocks crow at two different times of the night; viz., about midnight for the first time; and then about the time commonly called the cock crowing; and this was the cock crowing our Saviour spoke of; and therefore the other Evangelists take no notice of the first crowing.

*** chapter 15 ***

25 "The third hour": The ancient account divided the day into four parts, which were named from the hour from which they began; the first, third, sixth, and ninth hour. Our Lord was crucified a little before noon; before the third hour had quite expired; but when the sixth hour was near at hand.

*** chapter 16 ***

2 "The sun being now risen": They set out before it was light, to go to the sepulchre; but the sun was risen when they arrived there. Or, figuratively, the sun here spoken of is the sun of justice, Christ Jesus our Lord, who was risen before their coming.
