30 "Hardened": That is, in punishment of his past sins he left him to his own stubborn and perverse disposition, which drew him to his ruin. See the note on Ex. 7. 3.

*** chapter 8 ***

3 "Not in bread alone": That is, that God is able to make food of what he pleases for the support of man.
15 "The Dipsas": A serpent whose bite causeth a violent thirst; from whence it has its name, for in Greek dipsa signifies thirst.

*** chapter 9 ***


*** chapter 10 ***

6 "Mosera": By mount Hor, for there Aaron died, Num. 20. This and the following verses seem to be inserted by way of parenthesis.

*** chapter 11 ***

*** chapter 12 ***

32 "That only do thou": They are forbid here to follow the ceremonies of the heathens; or to make any alterations in the divine ordinances.

*** chapter 13 ***

9 "Presently put him to death": Not by killing him by private authority, but by informing the magistrate, and proceeding by order of justice.
13 "Belial": That is, without yoke. Hence the wicked, who refuse to be subject to the divine law, are called in scripture the children of Belial.

*** chapter 14 ***

3 "Unclean": See the annotations on Lev. 11.

*** chapter 15 ***

4 "There shall be no poor": It is not to be understood as a promise, that there should be no poor in Israel, as appears from ver. 11, where we learn that God's people would never be at a loss to find objects for their charity: but it is an ordinance that all should do their best endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships of poverty and want.

*** chapter 16 ***


*** chapter 17 ***

3 "The host of heaven": That is, the stars.
8 "If thou perceive": Here we see what authority God was pleased to give to the church guides of the Old Testament, in deciding, without appeal, all controversies relating to the law; promising that they should not err therein; and surely he has not done less for the church guides of the New Testament.

*** chapter 18 ***


*** chapter 19 ***


*** chapter 20 ***


*** chapter 21 ***


*** chapter 22 ***

6 "Thou shalt not take": This was to shew them to exercise a certain mercy even to irrational creatures; and by that means to train them up to a horror of cruelty; and to the exercise of humanity and mutual charity one to another.
8 "Battlement": This precaution was necessary, because all their houses had flat tops, and it was usual to walk and to converse together upon them.

*** chapter 23 ***

1 "Eunuch": By these are meant, in the spiritual sense, such as are barren in good works. Ibid.
1 "Into the church": That is, into the assembly or congregation of Israel, so as to have the privilege of an Israelite, or to be capable of any place or office among the people of God.
14 "No uncleanness": This caution against suffering any filth in the camp, was to teach them to fly the filth of sin, which driveth God away from the soul.
20 "To the stranger": This was a dispensation granted by God to his people, who being the Lord of all things, can give a right and title to one upon the goods of another. Otherwise the scripture everywhere condemns usury, as contrary to the law of God, and a crying sin. See Ex. 22. 25; Lev. 25. 36, 37; 2 Esd. 5. 7; Ps. 14. 5; Ezech. 18. 8, 13, etc.

*** chapter 24 ***


*** chapter 25 ***

4 "Not muzzle": St. Paul understands this of the spiritual labourer in the church of God, who is not to be denied his maintenance. 1 Cor. 9. 8, 9, 10.
17 "Amalec": This order for destroying the Amalecites, in the mystical sense, sheweth how hateful they are to God, and what punishments they are to look for from his justice, who attack and discourage his servants when they are but just come out, as it were, of the Egypt of this wicked world and being yet weak and fainthearted, are but beginning their journey to the land of promise.

*** chapter 26 ***

5 "The Syrian": Laban. See Gen. 27.

*** chapter 27 ***


*** chapter 28 ***

2 "All these blessings": In the Old Testament, God promised temporal blessings to the keepers of his law, heaven not being opened as yet; and that gross and sensual people being more moved with present and sensible things. But in the New Testament the goods that are promised us are spiritual and eternal; and temporal evils are turned into blessings.
15 "All these curses": Thus God dealt with the transgressors of his law in the Old Testament: but now he often suffers sinners to prosper in this world, rewarding them for some little good they have done, and reserving their punishment for the other world.

*** chapter 29 ***

4 "Hath not given you": Through your own fault and because you resisted his grace.
19 "The drunken": absumat ebria sitientem. It is a proverbial expression, which may either be understood, as spoken by the sinner, blessing, that is, flattering himself in his sins with the imagination of peace, and so great an abundance as may satisfy, and as it were, consume all thirst and want: or it may be referred to the root of bitterness, spoken of before, which being drunken with sin may attract, and by that means consume, such as thirst after the like evils.
29 "Secret things": As much as to say, secret things belong to, and are known to, God alone; our business must be to observe what he has revealed and manifested to us, and to direct our lives accordingly.

*** chapter 31 ***


*** chapter 32 ***


*** chapter 33 ***

8 "Holy man": Aaron and his successors in the priesthood.
9 "Who hath said": It is the duty of the priestly tribe to prefer God's honour and service before all considerations of flesh and blood: in such manner as to behave as strangers to their nearest akin, when these would withdraw them from the business of their calling.
12 "Shall dwell": This seems to allude to the temple being built in the confines of the tribe of Benjamin.
16 "The Nazarite": See the note on Gen. 49. 26.
21 "He saw": The pre-eminence of the tribe of Gad, to which this alludeth, was their having the lawgiver Moses buried in their borders; though the particular place was not known.
23 "The sea": The lake of Genesareth.
27 "Underneath are the everlasting arms": Though the dwelling of God be above in heaven, his arms are always stretched out to help us here below.

*** chapter 34 ***

5 "Died there": This last chapter of Deuteronomy, in which the death of Moses is related, was written by Josue, or by some of the prophets.
6 "He buried him": viz. by the ministry of angels, and would have the place of his burial to be unknown, lest the Israelites, who were so prone to idolatry, might worship him with divine honours.
