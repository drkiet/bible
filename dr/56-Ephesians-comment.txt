*** the book of Epistle Of Saint Paul To The Ephesians ***

*** chapter 1 ***

3 "In heavenly places": or, in heavenly things. In coelestibus.
14 "Acquisition": that is, a purchased possession.

*** chapter 2 ***

9 "Not of works": as of our own growth, or from ourselves; but as from the grace of God.

*** chapter 3 ***

15 "All paternity": Or, the whole family. God is the Father, both of angels and men; whosoever besides is named father, is so named with subordination to him.

*** chapter 4 ***

11 "Gave some apostles": Here it is plainly expressed, that Christ has left in his church a perpetual succession of orthodox pastors and teachers, to preserve the faithful in unity and truth.

*** chapter 5 ***

24 "Church is subject to Christ": The church then, according to St. Paul, is ever obedient to Christ, and can never fall from him, but remain faithful to him, unspotted and unchanged to the end of the world.

*** chapter 6 ***

12 "In the high places": or heavenly places. That is to say, in the air, the lowest of the celestial regions; in which God permits these wicked spirits or fallen angels to wander.
24 "In incorruption": That is, with a pure and perfect love.
