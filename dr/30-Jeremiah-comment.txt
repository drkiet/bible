*** chapter 3 ***


*** chapter 4 ***


*** chapter 5 ***


*** chapter 6 ***


*** chapter 7 ***

18 "Queen of heaven": That is, the moon, which they worshipped under that name.
22 "I commanded them not": Viz., such sacrifices as the Jews at this time offered, without obedience; which was the thing principally commanded: so that in comparison with it, the offering of the holocausts and sacrifices was of small account.

*** chapter 8 ***


*** chapter 9 ***


*** chapter 10 ***

23 "The way of a man is not his": The meaning is, that notwithstanding man's free will, yet he can do no good without God's help, nor evil without his permission. So that, in the present case, all the evils which Nabuchodonosor was about to bring upon Jerusalem, could not have come but by the will of God.

*** chapter 11 ***

20 "Sabaoth": That is, of hosts or armies, a name frequently given to God in the scriptures.-- Ibid.
20 "Thy revenge": This was rather a prediction of what was to happen, with an approbation of the divine justice, than an imprecation.

*** chapter 12 ***


*** chapter 13 ***


*** chapter 14 ***


*** chapter 15 ***

12 "Shall iron be allied": Shall the iron, that is, the strength of Juda, stand against the stronger iron of the north, that is, of Babylon: or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it? No certainly: but it must be broken by it.
15 "Do not defend me in thy patience": That is, let not thy patience and longsuffering, which thou usest towards sinners, keep thee from making haste to my assistance.

*** chapter 16 ***


*** chapter 17 ***

6 "Tamaric": A barren shrub that grows in the driest parts of the wilderness.
18 "Let them be confounded": Such expressions as these in the writings of the prophets, are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding from malice or desire of revenge: but as prophetic predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners, and approbations of the ways of divine justice.

*** chapter 18 ***

20 "Remember": This is spoken in the person of Christ, persecuted by the Jews, and prophetically denouncing the evils that should fall upon them in punishment of their crimes.

*** chapter 19 ***


*** chapter 20 ***

3 "Phassur": This name signifies increase and principality: and therefore is here changed to Magor-Missabib, or fear on every side: to denote the evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word of God.
7 "Thou hast deceived": The meaning of the prophet, is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls deceiving, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him.
12 "Let me see": This prayer proceeded not from hatred or ill will, but zeal of justice.
14 "Cursed be the day": In these, and the following words of the prophet, there is a certain figure of speech to express with more energy the greatness of the evils to which his birth had exposed him.

*** chapter 21 ***

13 "To thee that dwellest": He speaks to Jerusalem, confiding in the strength of her situation upon rocks, surrounded with a deep valley.

*** chapter 22 ***

1 "Go down": The contents of this chapter are of a more ancient date than those of the foregoing chapter: for the order of time is not always observed in the writings of the prophets.
6 "Galaad the head of Libanus": By Galaad, a rich and fruitful country, is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of David: by Libanus, a high mountain abounding in cedar trees, the populous city of Jerusalem.
7 "Prepare": Literally, sanctify.
10 "Weep not for him that is dead": He means the good king Josias, who by death was taken away, so as not to see the miseries of his country.-- Ibid.

30 "Write this man barren": That is, childless: not that he had no children, but that his children should never sit on the throne of Juda.

*** chapter 23 ***

34 "Burden of the Lord": This expression is here rejected and disallowed, at least for those times: because it was then used in mockery and contempt by the false prophets, and unbelieving people, who ridiculed the repeated threats of Jeremias under the name of his burdens.
39 "Out of my presence": That is, the Lord declares that out of his presence he will cast them, and bring them to captivity for their transgressions.

*** chapter 24 ***


*** chapter 25 ***

9 "My servant": So this wicked king is here called; because God made him his instrument in punishing the sins of his people.
12 "Punish": Literally, visit upon.
26 "Sesac": That is, Babel, or Babylon; which after bringing all these people under her yoke, should quickly fall and be destroyed herself.
38 "The dove": This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor, whose military standard, it is said, was a dove. But the Hebrew word Jonah, which is here rendered a dove, may also signify a waster or oppressor, which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince; or by comparison, as a dove's flight is the swiftest, so would their destruction come upon them.

*** chapter 26 ***


*** chapter 27 ***

1 "Joakim": This revelation was made to the prophet in the beginning of the reign of Joakim: but the bands were not sent to the princes here named before the reign of Sedecias, ver. 3.

18 "Neither shall there be cut off from the priests": This promise relates to the Christian priesthood; which shall also continue for ever: the functions of which (more especially the great sacrifice of the altar) are here expressed by the name of holocausts, and other offerings of the law, which were so many figures of the Christian sacrifice.
24 "Two families": Viz., the families of the kings and priests.

*** chapter 34 ***

5 "Die in peace": That is, by a natural death.

*** chapter 35 ***

2 "Rechabites": These were of the race of Jethro, father in law to Moses.

*** chapter 36 ***

5 "Shut up": Not that the prophet was now in prison; for the contrary appears from ver. 19, but that he kept himself shut up, by reason of the persecutions he had lately met with. See chap. 26.
30 "He shall have none": Because his son Joachin or Jechonias, within three months after the death of his father, was carried away to Babylon, so that his reign is not worthy of notice.

11 "Moab hath been fruitful": That is, rich and flourishing.
